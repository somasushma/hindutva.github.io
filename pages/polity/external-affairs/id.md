## Identification and rejection of nAstika-s (veda-rejectors)

- See veda section in holy books [page](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/0-1-pramanani-bases/0-15-holy-books-limits).
- "श्रुतिस्तु वेदो विज्ञेयो धर्मशास्त्रं तु वै स्मृतिः । ते सर्वार्थेष्वमीमांस्ये ताभ्यां धर्मो हि निर्बभौ ॥ योऽवमन्येत ते मूले हेतुशास्त्राश्रयाद् द्विजः । स साधुभिर्बहिष्कार्यो नास्तिको वेदनिन्दकः ॥" इति मनुः। तत्र मेधातिथिर् [अत्र](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc145584.html)।
- buddha (an avatAra or a veda-nindaka?)
    - "Guatama Buddha was a ‘nastika’ in the traditional sense of the term. The very definition of a ‘nastika’ is ‘nastiko veda-nindakah’ (Manusmriti 2.11)."
    - Stealing and corruption charge:
        
        -  मत्तविलासप्रहसनम् - वेदान्तेभ्यो गृहीत्वार्थान् यो महाभारतादपि । विप्राणां मिषतामेव कृतवान् कोशसञ्चयम् ॥ 
    - "Stalwarts of Hindu Philosophy like Kumarila Bhatta (the exponent of Purva-Mimamsa) took great pains to refute Buddhist systems Niralambana-vada and Shunya-vada in his ‘Shlokavartika’. Kumarila Bhatta says in the ‘Shlokavartika’ that “this denial (of reality of external objects) … was declared by the Buddha with the sole object of alienating the affection (of men from such worldly objects); and somehow or other, some people (the so-called followers Bauddha) fell into a mistake (and accepted it to its utmost extent, as denial of all substratum of cognitions)” (Shlokavartika 5.202, translation: Ganganath Jha)."
    - "It is noteworthy that several traditions in Hinduism do not identify Guatama Buddha with the Buddha ‘avatara’, but consider Lord Jagannatha to be the Buddha ‘avatara’ mentioned in Hindu Purana-s instead. Some Gaudiya Vaishnava commentators opine that the references to Buddha ‘avatara’ in Bhagavata refer to Buddha in another ‘kalpa’ and not Guatama Buddha of Buddhism."
        - Srimadbhagavatapurana (1st Skandha, 2nd chapter): बुद्धनाम्नाऽजनिसुतः कीकटेषु भविष्यति।
        - "Parameshwarnath Mishra in his Hindi books, 'अमिट कालरेखा : अर्वाचीनमतखण्डन' and 'अमिट कालरेखा : वितण्डावादिमतखण्डन' says that Gautama Buddha was born on the full-moon day of the month of Vaisakha, whereas Avatara Buddha was born on the 7th day of the bright half of the month of Pausa." 
    - "Even in the case Guatama Buddha is considered an ‘avatara’, he is not to be worshipped or followed in Sanatana Dharma. Agni Purana and Bhagavata Purana state that the purpose of the Buddha avatara was to delude the enemies of the gods (‘sammohaya suradvisham’, Bhagavata Purana 1.3.24). Tulasidasa states in the Dohavali “Tulasidasa has thought a lot \[and concluded that\] the glory of Veda-s is incomparable: it is well-known that on criticizing them (the Veda-s), even the Buddha ‘avatara’ become an object of criticism” (Dohavali 464)." \[NM17\]

## AryAvarta and the hindu identity

Nationalist/ pro-hindu-cultural sentiment and awareness of the mlechCha (including muslim) invasion and threat is evident in many places.

- As SR Goel says [here](http://www.voiceofdharma.org/books/siii/ch9.htm): "This vast land which Islam has dismembered in due course into the separate states of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Hindustan, and Bangladesh had been a single indivisible whole since times immemorial. Bharatavarsha had been termed by the ancients as the cradle of varNã�rama-dharma, witness to the wheel of the caturyugas, and the kShetra for chakravãrtya, spiritual as well as political. This historical memory and cultural tradition was alive as late as the imperial Guptas. Kalidasa had clothed it in immortal poetry in his far-famed RaghuvaMsa."
- Pilgrimage routes: "Everyone knows about the dvādaśa jyotirliṅga-s for the śaiva-s, the divyadeśa-s of the śrī vaiṣṇavas or the śaktipīṭha-s of the śākta-s, covering the whole of bhārata or even what we call, akhaṇḍabhārata." \[[GA](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2017/01/20/of-invisible-threads-the-veda-and-the-strangest-harikatha-experience/)\]
- The work of story-tellers:
    - "It is no coincidence that the mahābhārata is framed as janamejaya listening to vaiśampāyana at the sarpa-killing sattra or that the uttarakāṇḍa states how vālmīki has the sons of rāma go around the city singing the rāmāyaṇa on the occasion of the aśvamedha held by rāma or that ugraśrava sauti recites purāṇa-s to the sages at the sattra held by śaunaka. Indeed, when one traces the origin of this, one realizes the roots of a formalized public discourse lie in the hoary pāriplava rite of the aśvamedha where various branches of knowledge are recited to different groups, with the itihāsa-s and purāṇa-s being narrated to fishermen and bird-catchers." \[[GA](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2017/01/20/of-invisible-threads-the-veda-and-the-strangest-harikatha-experience/)\]
- The cultural unity of India is apparent in Indian and foreign literary works, epigraphs which describe various regions and customs of India (take Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsha or the Mahabharata as prominent examples). This was apparent to Indians across time. Examples:
    - Govindrao Kale to Nana Fadnis 2nd July 1792 \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/ColonelGerard/status/769052097711054848/photo/1)\]
    - bhAskarAchArya-makhIndra's [note](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/the-domain-of-india-according-to-bhaskararaya-makhindra/#like-6828).
    - To add to this, there was a clear (though not static) notion of what constituted the “Āryāvarta” or the land of the cultured people. All this points to a sense of pan-Indic cultural unity. Please see “Nationalism: Its Theory and Principles in India” by Parmanand Parashar for further details and references.
- Ability to clearly identify brAhmaNa-s fittest in the function of conserving pristine Arya vaidika ideals.

- There was a clear notion of the cultural other (called mleccha-s) is apparent in medieval works.

## Failure pattern  

- A lack of understanding of the threat the abrahamisms contributed to the lack of common hindu fronts against muslim and other mlecCha invaders.
    
- Yet, some acceptance of abrahamist form and norm might have been a part of the non-military response ([see here](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/vairinah/abrahamisms-generally). )  
    
- Also see [secularism here](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/vairinah/4-idiot-intellectualism/4-secularism).
- nAtha-sampradAya
    - " Of the 13 Nath sub-orders, I understand the Rawal or Nagnath order of Punjab consisted of Muslims though it traced its ancestry to Shiva. One book says that the 1891 census listed about 17% of the wandering Yogis as Muslims! The collection of verses named Gorakhbani attributed to Gorakhnath (13th or 14th century) has several verses praising the glory of the Prophet Mohammed."  
        
    - "I understand that in 2005 a book was published under the authority of the Yogī Mahāsabhā. "This book, written in Hindi by Yogī Vilāsnāth, secretary to the Mahāsabhā in Haridwar, is entitled Śrī Nāth Rahasya (‘the secrets of Śrī Nāth’) and is a compendium of mantras to be recited during specific rituals. A passage in the last section of the book is entitled Mohammad Bodh, ‘Mohammad’s wisdom'!" A sample of the text: Salutation to the True Name, Salutation to the Guru. Om Guruji! Alhā bismillā (devtā) Ram is Rahim. Om is Mohammad. The head is the mosque, the skull is madār .21 The ear is Sudh Granth (the Qur’an). The eye is the prophet." \[[FB17](https://www.facebook.com/pakshirajan.ananthakrishnan/posts/1819041841455325)\]
