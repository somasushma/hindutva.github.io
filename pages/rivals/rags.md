title: Dirty rags

- General unreliability of modern Indian media.
    - [2015list](http://www.opindia.com/2015/10/top-lies-spread-by-indian-media-in-september-2015/?utm_content=buffer4f169&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer).
- On anti-hindu (especially Indian) media's portrayal of hindu-s as idots.
    - Various rags keep sensationalizing pro-hindu stances by misrepresenting them and drawing false equivalences.
    - Some have a couple of redeeming features (eg: [here](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10152793456577989?notif_t=like))- 
        - they are honest about being caricatures.
        - A pro-hindu person that takes it for an attempted demonstration of absurdity can go and point out the misrepresentation.
    - In my (pre-Modi) experience, many news outlets which publish silly anti-hindu pieces don't do that - they disallow all pro-hindu comments; or adapt a more sinister strategy - disallow all intelligent and measured pro-hindu comments while allowing ones with bad grammar and abuses.
- International western media and various "human rights" agencies work as a propaganda tool of the west
    - Mode of operation
        - often circulating false, unsubstantiated and one-sided claims.
        - Sensationalism whenever a pro-hindu (BJP) government is in power. Eg. presenting riots, bans of food/ books etc.. as if they happen only in pro-hindu governments.

    - Some of it is due to the mlecCha-s' lack of context combined with undue vehemence - also discussed [here](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/vairinah/academic-subversion).
    - Dalit/ women/ caste suppression lies.
        -  Fake dalit rape petition - Amnesty international - [AmnRap15](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/amnesty-fuelling-the-indian-rape-myth/17406#.VfMlFrMM_Bc.twitter). (Compare with associated nonsense in famous rags - [img](http://i.imgur.com/eMTDF5E.png) )
        - Dalit killed and set ablaze - false \[ [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/0Vz6rKX.jpg)15\]
    - Singling out hindus for curtailment of freedom of speech

(It is not just hindu-s who attack it (unlike what these mlecCha rags would have you and others believe) - but also christians (take contemporaneous [http://indianexpress.com/.../twist-in-nun-play-row.../](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/twist-in-nun-play-row-director-says-he-fears-for-his-life/) ) and muslims.
