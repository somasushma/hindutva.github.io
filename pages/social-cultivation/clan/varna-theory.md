title: varNa theory
---
## Introduction

varNa/ jAti = (social role/ hereditary caste) system.  

## Motivation for the varNa construct.

- A brAhmaNa varNa fully dedicated to conserving Arya ideals is a great advantage to the memeplex- see vaidika-brAhmaNa-glue part of [this](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/3-civilizational-appraisal/jatih-varnah/indo-aryans-in-india#TOC-vaidika-brAhmaNa-glue).
- Formalization of a natural phenomenon, amalgamation of tribes glued together by the Arya brAhmaNa-s.
    - Hindu society was an amalgam of many tribes (jAti-s). The varNa system (centered around the ritualist conservative core described [here](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/3-civilizational-appraisal/jatih-varnah/indo-aryans-in-india)) tried to harmonize them. When new jAti-s were encountered, they could be gracefully integrated into the broader society, while preserving their internal autonomy.
    - That this varNa system was an ancient emergent phenomenon - not artificially created - was the opinion of the ancients.
        - This is the import of the puruSha-sUkta, where its emergence from the primeval puruSha is placed in  the verse that describes the emergence of sun and the moon.
        - manu says in the manu-smRti that this division emerged from brahma himself.
    - Division of labor has been observed in nature - most famously in case of insects such as wasps, ants, bees etc.., whose colonies have led to group selection. Among the non-human great apes, power hierarchies have been observed. (To check: To what extant are these hereditary.) So, it is plausible that specialization since childhood, and limitations on social mobility may have provided a competitive edge to early human societies.
    - Hindu-s happened to document and adapt this limitation on social mobility to preserve excellence in socially valuable trades.
- Plausibility of competitive edge:
    - "It is indeed true that having the whole population fighting provides numerical advantage. It appears in chimps there is no particular soldier caste.  ... Now certain ‘Kriegstaat’-societies indeed take that route. For example, the Mongols were one such. ...  Now a society which has alternative structure when under stress will transform into this Kriegstaat pattern. We saw that with Mahārāṇa Pratāpa. We saw it on even larger scales with the Marāthā-s. ... But in the long run it is a more diversified economy that allows the effective conduct of war. Thus, it means other castes performing their specialized roles and channeling the fruits of the diversified economy to the war machine, which itself is primarily performed a dedicated caste. At a basic level this might mean farmers who can produce food, a essential to field large armies but it can involve various other specialized sub-groups. When the Marāthā-s transformed into a Kriegstaat, that seems to have drawn people away from these specialized guilds. That is where the English won. They could still maintain a large body of seemingly ‘useless’ knowledge-producers, like a Darwin and a Maxwell, for each of whom there were lesser tinkerers who could ultimately supply key technological innovations to the system that kept edge on the English war-machine. The success of this type of specialization in nature is simply evident in the world conquest of the ants, bees and termites." \[[MT17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/of-lives-of-men-of-times-of-men-iii/)\]
    - "Agent-based simulation results show that in constant environments, unequal access to resources can be demographically destabilizing, resulting in the outward migration and spread of such societies even when population size is relatively small. In variable environments, stratified societies spread more and are also better able to survive resource shortages by sequestering mortality in the lower classes. The predictions of our simulation are provided modest support by a range of existing empirical studies. In short, the fact that stratified societies today vastly outnumber egalitarian societies may not be due to the transformation of egalitarian norms and structures, but may instead reflect the more rapid migration of stratified societies and consequent conquest or displacement of egalitarian societies over time." \[[PLOS12](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024683)\]  
        
    - The division of power inherent in the jAti/ varNa system enabled India to resist and weather brutal invasions, as posited in the "Politics .." section.
    - In the past, groups of people were highly specialized - warfare, trading, teaching/ counselling.
        - Specialization/ training from childhood could inculcate excellence.
        - Further, varNa/jAti-pride might have promoted special efforts at excellence.
        - The varna/ jAti system might have been a \_crude\_ approximation of the distribution of skills among hindu human resources. That way, precious resources such as advanced education (eg. the shAstra-s) could have been allotted to the most appropriate jAti-s.
            - There is genetic basis for differences in abilities (cognitive and otherwise). That said, it is also true that there are very significant non-genetic factors influencing the development of intelligence (look up the Flynn effect). Further there could be epigenetic factors.
    - The distribution of risks and abilities is not independent of birth - so relying just on estimated personality qualities (= reliance on guNa-dharma) may not suffice.
        - A modern example: अमेरिकराष्ट्रपतिर् अत्र जात एव भवितुमर्हतीति नियमः कठोरः। नागरीकोऽप्य् आबाल्यात् राजोचितगुणोपेतोऽपि Henry Kissinger सदृशो जनो नार्हति तम् पदम्।
- A memeplex that places emphasis in the following order: scholarship and conservation of Arya values (brAhmaNa-s) >> governance and defence (kShatriya-s) >> commerce (vaiShya-s) >> service (shUdra-s)
    - This orients a society to hold sacredness and spirituality above mere material achievements.
- The desirability of maintenance of higher standards of behavior (refinement/ samskAra) by more people with more critical social functions.
    - dharmashAstra-s concerned themselves with the preservation of standards. जन्मना जायते शूद्रः संस्काराद् द्विज उच्यते। वेदपाठाद्भवेद् विप्रः ब्रह्म जानाति ब्राह्मणः॥ \[ supposedly - अत्रिस्मृति १४१\] \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/01/05/south-indian-hindu-legal-authorities-of-the-middle-period/)\]
        - For example, in the case of brAhmaNa-s were more respected for both of the following reasons \[[AA](https://archive.org/stream/paNDit-papers/ScholasticismPanditTraditionalScholarshipInIndiaFestschriftOrCommeomorationParameswaraAithalAxelMichaelsarticles#page/n51/mode/2up)\]
            - knowledge of the shAstra-s,
            - the following of some severe codes of conduct. It also explores the differences in society that support these/ result from such divergent types of scholarship.
        - One without saMskAra-s has lost his dvija-status (and so do his descendents). The codifiers took it seriously (eg: loss of dvija-status in manu smRti), and it was taken seriously in practice (to some extant).
        - In the other direction (what if a person, initially without dvija-status, somehow gets all the saMskAra-s), I am not sure that the codifiers took such a possibility seriously. So in practice, one sees acquisition of dvija-status.
        - More about jAtyutkarsha and jAtyapakarsha in [PV Kane's book](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n119/mode/2up).
        - Consider rAmAnuja's commentary on [Chapter 3, Verse 24](http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-03-24.html) ([sanskrit](http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=3&field_nsutra_value=24&scram=1&choose=1), en) of bhagavadgItA, where kRShNa refers to saMkara as a negative, saying: "put your kula before yourself if you are a person of a shiShTa-kula, just as I do -- you have a special burden to bear".
    - Higher punishment for higher castes in general.
        - Almost every king in ancient India followed the dharmashAstra-s in settling disputes and conducting his affairs.
            - This continued through to vijayanagara (the great vidyAraNya authored the parAshara smRti commentary, this guided the vijayanagara kings) and marATha confrederacy. Even the british formed their hindu law using translated dharmashAstra digests.
        - The dharmashAstra-s have different recommendations (particularly with regards to AchAra, prAyashcitta, daNDa) for people belonging to different varNa-s. Other factors (according to texts like daNDa-viveka) that determined the punishment included sex, wealth etc..
            - For example, higher varNa-s get higher punishment in almost all cases (excepting adultery and defamation), limited to loss of limb in case of women and brAhmaNa-s; according to manu, kAtyAyana and vyAsa. \[[PVK](http://i.imgur.com/AnkLxKR.jpg), [FB](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153134112067989&set=a.10151672801737989.1073741826.689472988&type=1&permPage=1)\]
        - So, the determination of varNa was essential (jAti providing an essential clue in this determination).
- Ritual purity.
    - Some occupations were considered unclean and untouchable. Eg: Skinning dead animals, ferrying sewage. This violated popular notions of ritual purity in several paths of hindu self-cultivation.
- Self interest
    - It was in the interest of powerful jAti-s to maintain their power by denying others a fair chance to compete in their specialized roles. This self interest, though real, finds no theological basis as a valid source of the jAti system.
- Some origin stories
    - \[[AS94](http://www.jstor.org/stable/606171?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\] refers to puruSha-sUkta and dharmashAstra-s, a shUdra bhaTTa account and a vaishya agarvAla bhaTTa account

## Theoretical Structure

- A chAturvarNya universalism. The dharmashAstra-s claimed to explain the origin of EVERY SINGLE population they were aware of - out of admixture and fall of the 4 original varNa-s.​ According to the early smRti-s there was no fifth ([PVK1](http://i.imgur.com/l0XuhbQ.jpg), [PVK2](http://i.imgur.com/LRHL6vV.jpg)). This is a sort of universally applicable framework. They had various  (sometimes peripherally incompatible) theories for their origins, and the ultimate varNa assignment was very very clear. Even the deities had varNa-s \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n99/mode/2up)\] assigned to them! 
    
- The 4 main varNa-s were the brAhmaNa-s, kShatriya-s, vaishya-s (ie dvija-s) and shUdras, who were of two major categories - aniravasita and niravasita.
    
    - Besides these there were tribes who were not following the varNa-system (perhaps because of living in distant lands or in inaccessible places), who were termed as dasyus. They were also termed mlechCha-s if they spoke a very different language.
        
    - In some later works, niravasita-shUdra-s were called avarNa-s (bRhatsamhitA [89.1b](https://archive.org/stream/Brihatsamhita/brihatsamhita#page/n709/mode/2up)).
        

### Prominent traits in the varNa-s:

- Difference in the dominant or prominent occupations.
    - Consequently, difference in AchAra-s.
    - Main professions
        - The dvija-s had to compulsorily have appropriate saMskAra-s, and pursue study of sacred lore (adhyayana), yajJNa (sacrifice) and dAna (giving).
        - Initially, the professions for livelihood were these:
            - teaching and scholarship in sacred lore, accepting gifts, conducting sacrifices (brAhmaNa-s) 
                - Later, archaka-posts in certain Agamika temples were reserved for initiated brAhmaNa-s, due to such decision by a deity or a highly revered sage. Rare reservations were made for other communities as well (see [practice page](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/3-civilizational-appraisal/jatih-varnah/1-3-varna-practice)). 
                    - Deities appointing specific lineages
                        - \[sEkkizAr's periyapurANam, mANikkavAcakar - [TW17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/916607415667363840), kAmikAgama  6.6 - 6.9 [TW17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/916811078507618305) \].
                        - The vaikhAnasa samhitas mention that this community was created by Vishnu and not thru brahma. The child is initiated at the foetal stage through viShNu-bali.
                            - bhagavAn explicitly stated his desire to receive vaikhAnasa service only at tirumala. For 12 yrs, moolamurti was not touched by anyone.. Puja done by sri vyasaraya from outside temple, as the only descendant of bimbaadhara, appointed by raamaanuja, was an infant. If a yati of that caliber did not dare enter sanctum sanctorum, who are we?
                        - the mother at AvuDaiyAr temple (built by mANikkavAcaka) desires that only brAhmaNas of the rare agniveshya sUtra should serve her.
                    - Such specific brAhmaNa lineages are said to be exempt from the devalaka-doSha that befalls brAhmaNa archaka-s according to the smRti-s. While others fall in status.
                        - Even the shaivAgama which detests common brAhmaNas doing arcana gives a max limit of 3 years for initiated common Brahmins and 6 months for uninitiated ones before they become degraded
                    - Pancaratra allows archakas to be from all castes subject to certain conditions.
                        - "There are many bhajana temples with murtis where saattaadas serve. There r many bhajana temples with murtis where saattaadas serve. But the main archaka in old pancaratra temples has to be a SYV kanva shakha brom of five gotras and initiated in pancaratra diksha by his own father. ... The chief arcaka in shrIraNGam was handpicked from one such gotra by rAmAnuja himself."
            - >\> governance and defence (kShatriya-s) 
            - >\> commerce, agriculture, etc.. (vaiShya-s) 
            - >\> service, agriculture etc.. (shUdra-s).
        - The brAhmaNa-s were barred from overt pursuit of wealth. (This was not a mere ideal, but was actually practiced -- as observed by many people, including PV kANe.)
        - In contrast with early Arya society, shUdra-s of later times were recognized to have the avocation of service and agriculture.
- Gradation relative to each other (despite their complementaryness)
    - brAhmaNa >= kShatriya > vaiShya > aniravasita shUdra > niravasita shUdra >= populations outside not following chAturvarNya (dasyu-s). 
        - This hierarchy was justified using hypothesized karma from past lives.
            - Eg. bhAgavadgItA calling women, shUdra-s and vaishya-s pApa-yonis.
    - The recommendation by medhAtithi about expanding AryAvarta by a king subjugating the mlechCha-s, and relegating them to the position of chaNDAla-s (niravasita shUdra-s) should make the view of dharmashAstra writers about the place of mlechCha-s in the hierarchy abundantly clear ([PVK_IMG](http://i.imgur.com/rWyjGFD.jpg)). They were considered impure and untouchable ([PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n225/mode/2up)).
    - Consequently, difference in the severity of daNDa (punishments) and , with authorities such as manu and vyAsa prescribing (in nearly all cases) heftier punishments on higher castes.
    - This was motivated not just due to importance of social function, but also because of severe codes of conduct and refinement (tapas and samskAra), as described in the Motivation section.
- Hereditary nature for the most part.
- Restrictions on marriage: endogamy > anuloma exogamy (male of higher caste) > pratiloma exogamy.
    - varNa-s resulting from anuloma unions were considered dvija-s.
    - pratiloma unions (formal or otherwise) were severely discouraged, and their offspring were considered shUdra-s or worse \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n109/mode/2up)\]. "शूद्र.सधर्माणो वा, अन्यत्र चण्डालेभ्यः ॥" \- कौटिल्यः।
        - This applies to suta-s (theoretically illegitimate offspring/ descendents of xatriya males and brAhmaNa females) as well \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n155/mode/2up)\]. The sUta and mAgadha of purANa-s is entirely different according to (kauTilya ०३.७.२९) पौराणिकस् त्व् अन्यः सूतो मागधश् च, ब्रह्म.क्षत्राद् विशेषः ॥
- Restrictions on interdining.
- Different expectations in terms of conduct and personality traits (guNa-s)
    - Gita 18.41says: " ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशां शूद्राणां च परंतप। कर्माणि प्रविभक्तानि स्वभावप्रभवैर्गुणैः।।" Nilakanthacharya commentary takes close adherance to the shamAdi-sAdhAraNa-dharma as an example of contrast: "तस्माद्यस्मिन्कस्मिंश्चिद्वर्णे शमादयो दृश्यन्ते स शूद्रोऽप्येतैर्लक्षणैर्ब्राह्मण एव ज्ञातव्यः । यत्र च ब्राह्मणेऽपि शूद्रधर्मा दृश्यन्ते स शूद्र एव ।"

### Changing varNa.

- Possibly from ritual success: SB 10.4.1.10 \[[SB](https://archive.org/stream/SatapathaBrhamanaMadhyandinaEd.SridharSharmaVol10NagPublications/Satapatha%20Brhamana%20Madhyandina%20Ed.%20Sridhar%20Sharma%20Vol%2010%20Nag%20Publications#page/n171/mode/1up), [SB_tr](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.48505/2015.48505.The-Satapatha-brahmana--Pt-4#page/n373/mode/2up)\]
- From mistakes in ritual:
    - AB 7.29 \[[sAyaNa](https://archive.org/stream/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series/ASS_032_Aitareya_Brahmanam_with_Sayanabhashya_Part_2_-_Kasinathsastri_Agase_1896#page/n352/mode/1up)\] speaks of offspring of a kSatriya sacrificer becoming brAhmaNa/vaishya/shUdra due to errors.
- It was relatively easy to fall in varNa (though not encouraged). The dharmashAstra-s allowed each varNa to take up the profession of the varNa following it, in case of trouble or inability to sustain oneself and one's dependents using one's own permitted avocations; though one was required to return to one's profession when the trouble was past. Within 3-4 generations, this change would be permanent.
    - kShatriya-s and brAhmaNa-s taking up the profession of vaiShya-s.
    - brAhmaNa-s taking up the profession of kShatriya-s.
- Marriage route: It was theoretically possible to rise in varNa in a few generations by means of a series of a series of marriages. But there is nearly no evidence of this happening in practice.
- Rising to vaishya-like-status
    - suprabhedAgama: "kathitaścāthaśūdrastu satśūdraṃ vaiśyavat smaret | amadyapāḥ kulīnāstu satśūdrāste prakīrtitāḥ || 2-16 |"
- Alternate routes to rise to kShatriya status (These were often seen in practice.)
    - Perform the hiraNyagarbha rite (atharva-veda-parishiShTa [13.2](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/2_paris/avpari_u.htm) morphed with regional anukalpa-s and paddhati-s)
        - According to practice and paddhati-s, this involves offering up a golden calf (sometimes substituted by bronze as by vIrarAghava nAyaka).
        - The yajamAna is popularly considered to have taken a second birth (parishiShTa clues - rājā hiraṇyagarbhatvam abhīpsaty asmin bhavanto 'numanyantām iti.  ).
        - The phala is very general, according to the parishiShTa - whatever the brAhmaNa-s grant. 
    -  parAkhya - amadyapaḥ kulīnaśca nityaṃ dharma parāyaṇaḥ | śūdraḥ kṣatriyavat jñeyaśśeṣā nindyāstato bhṛśam ||
    - Falsely claim descent from a kShatriya clan.
- Ascent to brAhmaNa-hood
    - kApAlika-s, supposedly founded by a vaishya and his shUdra student, attempted significant subversion of the varNAshrama-dharma - as attested by rAmAnuja. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/03/26/dvijas-and-non-dvijas-in-the-shaiva-cults/)\]

### Mitigations and limitations (barring rare exceptions)

- On the positive end, one observes rarity of the more severe forms of slavery - unlike slave societies of Greece, Rome, Islamic states, early USA. The dharmashAstra tradition forbids any enforcing service by those bound by dharma ("न च बलात् स्वीकर्तव्यः…" [shabara on MS7,6,6](https://imgur.com/a/BWs34%5C), [tr](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.282745/2015.282745.Sabara-Bhasya#page/n493/mode/2up)).
    - Example - Megasthenese [TW1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/721326921724882945).
- Most occupations were open to all jAti-s or varNa-s.
    - We don't have the slightest problem loving the mahAbhArata written by the rustic smelly son of a fisherwoman (mentioned thusly in the mahAbhArata) about her descendents, with shUdra heroes like vidura the brahmajjnAnI cum super-archer, ekalavya, ghaTotkacha; while simultaneous supporting a more fluid social dynamic.
    - **Ministership** for all!
        - "mahAbhArata's prescription (an ostensibly "brahmanical" source) placed in the mouth of the dying grandfather bhISma, as part of his lectures on statecraft, that a king should have 4 brAhmaNa & 4 shUdra ministers, 8 kSatriya ministers and 21 vaishya ministers. This may be due to the complexity of regulating various trades and crafts in an ncreasingly sophisticated society."
- Unrestricted ability to enter intellectual/ spiritual life and pursue the ultimate Ananda (joy).
    - Prior to the turuShka invasion, the nAstika sects especially offered channel of entry to an intellectual life and social respect by common people.
    - "far from the non-brāhmaṇa population being disenfranchised and deprived of knowledge and rituals, the brāhmaṇa-s constantly innovated new texts, paths and strategies to significantly circumvent any restrictions, which may have been in place... As it is in a diverse, polytheist society, every group of Hindus, has a general right to create its own traditions and develop an exclusive ritual space for its own needs. The rural traditions centred around their local, village pantheons as well as the tribal systems had their own separate, sacred spaces. Even then, brāhmaṇa-s, who overwhelmingly were responsible for developing the śrauta, gṛhya, paurāṇika and āgamika ritual content, were interested in expanding access for their non- brāhmaṇa brethren." \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
    - The case of niShAdha-sthapati-s and rathakAra-s in the veda-s set a good precedent for expanding access for others to enter the broad vaidika system \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
    - shrI-vaiShNava-s
        - āgamaprāmāṇya of yAmunAchArya - "kimiti vā tatparigrahādaprāmāṇyam atraivarṇikatvāditi cet kiṃ bhoḥ traivarṇiketarasavarṇa rathakāraniṣādādi parigṛhītānuṣṭhīyamānārthānām atharvaṇavacasāṃ rathakāra ādadhīta etayā niṣādasthapatiṃ yājayet ityādivacasāṃ prāmāṇyaṃ nāsti |" \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
        - bhaṭṭāraka śrī vedottama: "śūdrasyāpyādhikārād avaidikatvam iti yad uktaṃ tad asat, sthapatīṣṭivad upapatteḥ। yathaiva hi “niṣāda sthapatiṃ yājayed” ityatra vācaniko’dhikāraḥ siddhaḥ, tathehāpi bhaviṣyati। “śrāvayec caturo varṇān” iti vacanād itihāsa purāṇādai yathaiva śūdrasyāpyādhikārād, na cāvaidikatvaṃ, tathātrāpi bhaviṣyati ।" \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
        - The shrIvaiShNava tradition includes shudra saints ( [Alvars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvars) ) with stories of their greatness and brAhmaNa-s falling at their feet. Plenty are such religious movements - eg: [vIrashaiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingayat)-s, sikh-s.
        - shrIvaiShnava Initiation - pancha-samskAra (prapatti/ samAshrayaNam) is available to all people irrespective of caste - [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7jG3GJ8NK0).
    - shaiva-siddhAnta
        -  kāmikāgama uttarabhāga 23.220-221a : "ityevaṃ kathitā dīkṣā sarvapāpavimocanī | catvāro brāhmaṇādyāścāpyanulomāśca ye matāḥ || nyāyajā gūḍhajātā vā dīkṣāyāmadhikāriṇaḥ |" \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
        - hierarchical guru-authority: "viprādayastrayo varṇāḥ dīkṣāyāṃ sthāpane’pi ca | brāhmaṇakṣatriyādīnāṃ kṣatriyaḥ śūdra vaiśyayoḥ || vaiśyaḥ śūdrasya dīkṣāyāṃ svasyajātāvapīṣyate | svārtheṣṭau cala liṃgasya pratiṣṭhāyāṃ trayasvime || śūdropi śūdradīkṣāyāṃ svārthe ca calasaṃjñake |" \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]

### Enforcement

- Abhinavagupta on varNavyavasthA : "कृतयुगे सत्त्वोत्कर्षबलादेव सर्वः स्वधर्ममनुपालयति । अद्यत्वे तु राजसत्वाच्छूद्रप्रकाराः करणादिजातीयाः सर्वेऽखर्वगर्वाक्रान्ता वर्णत्रयानुवृत्तिं न विदधते । शास्त्रं भवद्भ्य एवमादिशतीति च ते वचनमात्रेण नाद्रियन्ते । " (Natyashastra, chapter. 1)
    - "In the kRtayuga, everyone was dominated by the attribute of sattva and therefore performed his/her respective duties. But in these times, sub-castes among shUdra-s such as the karaNa are dominated by rajas. Gripped by excessive pride, they do not obey the other 3 varNa-s "This is what the shastra-s enjoin for you" - this, they acknowledge not even at the level of words."

### Contrast of privileges.

- The dharma system was framed more in terms of duties than rights or privileges. This fundamental difference should not be forgotten. However, in modern debates, it sometimes becomes necessary to get an accurate picture of privileges that existed in practice.

        - "There is a rule about ocean cross at least starting from an interpolated passage in bodhayana and you see the sentiment in later smritis. But it is not universal hindu practice."
        - "Various brahmanas historically have done it and helped established hindu kingdoms in south east. They've composed mantra manuals of which few fragments survive - eg. khADgArNava fragments from Indonesia."
        - "अस्माकमुदधिपारगतत्वमाकाशमार्गचारिणा वायुयानेनाऽभवन्न तु जलकपोतयानेन समुद्रसंयानेन वा  (कृष्णयजुर्वेदीयतैत्तिरीयशाखाया: बौधायनधर्मसूत्रेषु २.१.२.२. – “समुद्रसंयानम्” – अत्र विवरणव्याख्यानकर्तुः श्रीगोविन्दस्वामिनोऽभिप्राय: समुद्रयानेन/जलपोतयानेन द्वीपावान्तरयात्रायां पर्यवस्यति न त्वाकाशमार्गेण वायुयानेन) ।" इति केचित्।
        - baudhAyana-dharma-sUtra implies that vaidika karma-s can only be conducted in the "madhya-desha", not even in kalinga, vanga, AraTTa, gAndhAra etc.. - going where expiation is required \[[TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/874755837155082240)\]. Yet, we observe baudhAyana-s and vaidika-s in kerala and TN.
        - Plausible tales: "Pallavamalla narasimhavarmans pancaraatrin guru came from cambodia/malaysia by sea. The guru is depicted on walls of vaikuntha perumal temple. "

### Untouchability

The following classes of people / circumstances were subject to untouchability rules according to the smRti-s:

- A person who has committed a grave sin (mahApAtaka), but has not performed prAyashchitta.
- People whose spiritual practices were abhorrent to certain other people. Eg - bauddha-s jaina-s nAstika-s, even pAshupata-s and sAnkhya-s according to some texts.
- People following undersirable professions. Eg. a devalaka, a purohita for an entire village, hunter, butcher, fisherman etc..
- People in circumstances generating ashaucha. Eg.
    - Women in their periods.
    - A person shortly after a relative's death or a birth.
    - An uchChiShTa who is yet to wash his hands after/ while eating.
    - A person who has touched a corpse, but is yet to bathe.
- Certain races such as the mlechCha-s.

#### Untouchable jAti-s

- There is no compelling evidence that untouchability existed in the Vedic Indo Aryan society.
- The smRti-s also do not recognize people the existance of people within the hindu society who were excluded from the 4 varNa-s and untouchable.

## Role of later traditions

Some people falsely generalize later anti-varNAshrama traditions.

- Agamika pAncharAtra tradition strongly supports varNAshrama-dharma.
    - See quotes in the "Unrestricted ability to enter intellectual/ spiritual life" section.
- shaiva-siddhAnta supports varNAshrama-vyavasthA.
    - "iti varNAshramAchArAn manasApi na la~nghayet | yo yasminn Ashrame tiShThan dIkShitaH shivashAsane | sa tasminn eva samtiShThech ChivadharmaM ca pAlayet || ... siddhAnta shaiva did not forsake his Ashrama or varNa when he attained dIkSha into the shaiva path and was not a means of “revolting against” or “escaping” the ordinances of the Aryas. ... the general followers were encouraged to maintain their existing life-style/profession and varNa-related observances, while accomodating the shaiva observances with that framework. In fact the basic dharma-shAstric injunctions are relating to other nitya issues are reiterated by the shiva-dharma." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/06/23/siddhanta-tantrics-and-the-mainstream-brahminical-path/)\]
