## Socio-cultural ethos

### Heathen polity

Broader hindu world is included in the Heroes page.

We are after all their closest inheritors.  

- Julian, the last pagan emperor of Rome.
- Porphyry, the Greek, author of the brilliant “Against the Christians”, who was beaten up by a Christian mob in Caesarea, Palestine. \[[M](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/)\]
- Proclus (Πρόκλος), the mathematician, and the last RShi of the yavana-s, who [preserved](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens) for some time the statue of Athena uprooted in 435 CE by the edict of the rascal Theodosius.
- Martyrs such as Porphyry (author of "Against the Christians"), Hypatia - who were murdered by Christians.  
    
- Khosrau, Anushirvan, pre-Islamic emperor of Persia (531 – 79), who gave refuge to neo-platonist scholars chased away by Christian goons led by Justinian. Critical in spurring contributions to science from (often nominal) muslims in later times.
- Babek khoremi, the Persian heathen fighter against the Arab madmen, brutally executed in the end as usual. \[[M](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/15/babek-khoremi-and-mahizadyar/)\]
- Mahizadyar the Parthian, Babek's associate, who vowed to restore the Sassanian regime, the Persian language (which was being displaced by Arabic) and overthrow the Arabs. \[[M](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/15/babek-khoremi-and-mahizadyar/)\]
- [SuLu Khan](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/03/04/su-lu-khans-heroic-struggle-against-the-army-of-islam/), Kakhan of the Tuergish, who led a coalition of pagans (including parsi-s and Tibetans) in the defence against a coalition of Islamic forces and the Chinese.  
    
- Mansur Al Hallaj, who chose a  painful death, rather than lie about his atheism in 10th century even as the the Kalif (a fellow atheist) begged him to lie; who was shockingly digested by the later intolerant monotheist sUfi tradition.
- Amasanji Taiji, son of Esen Taiji (tamer of the Ming), ruler of the oirats, who defeated and reversed the Islam blight spreading among his people \[[M](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/some-notes-on-the-rise-of-oirat-power-and-the-jangar-tuuli/)\].
- Tokugawa Iyesu, who exterminated the preta blight from japan.
- George Gemistos Plethon \[[M](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/)\], who was an "underground" Pagan with a pan-heathen vision, preceptorial grandfather of Leonardo Da Vinci.  
    
- Giordano Bruno \[[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno)\], pantheist, tried for heresy and burnt at the stake.

#### Villains

- Jogaila, grand duke of Lithuania, who for the Polish throne \[1386\] sold the gods and damned Lithuanians down the Christian hierarchy \[[AH17](https://arithharger.wordpress.com/2017/05/06/the-last-european-pagans-part-ii-resistance/)\].

## Politics

- Kaiser (Caeser) Augustus Octavian, first emperor, avenger of his adapted father's murder, bringer of virtue and strength.
- Taizong, relentlessly legalist expansionist emperor of china,  born of a Han father in the lineage of Laozi the founder of Taoism and a mother from a subsidiary clan of Blue Turks, through a series of victories raised the chIna-s to their greatest glory, a tall and powerful man, said to tower imperiously above his cowering fellow chIna-s, a rather impressive personality with a good knowledge of chIna scientific texts and artistic skill in calligraphy, instituted a system with the Taoism and bauddha dharma as the outer coat for the inner core of legalism centered on his persona, adopted Turkic customs such as as allowing chIna women to ride horses and letting his sons live in yurts on the palace-grounds and speaking with them in Turkic, despite his ministers’ advice to the contrary, he clearly outlined his policy of sending the Han to settle all territory he conquered. Subdued rival turks, checked and allied with songtsen gampo the tibhoTa, sent spies (including Xuanzang) to India and attempted a failed invasion \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/the-successors-of-the-kaunteya-s-in-the-national-memory-of-bharata-s-and-bhota-s-and-related-discursions/)\].
- chingIz kha-khAn, the great conqueror.
    - "The population of Mongolia at the time of the great Khan is estimated to have been around 700,000 people, who were divided and lost in conflict. ... Despite all this background the best of the earlier Uighur Kha’khans and Khitan Khans were not Chingiz Khan. Thus, the backdrop of the buildup of innovations among the Altaic people, rather than contradicting, actually shows that Chingiz Khan stood apart from the best the steppe had produced. There are two sides to this, military and administrative. "\[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\].
- Benjamin Franklin the polymath.
- Robert Smalls. * Born into slavery.   * Started out with seriously unpleasant menial jobs. Taught himself to read. More importantly, taught himself navigational trigonometry. This is not simple to do yourself. This is especially not simple to do when you grew up speaking Gullah creole, and your first exposure to standard-dialect English was when you were ten.   * In general, was seriously awful at being a slave. Ran away. Resold tobacco and candy to make money his master didn't have access to. Bailed out of slave lockup over and over again because, despite the fact he never took to the whip, he was too competent to punish.  * Stole a Confederate ship. Sailed off with it. Gave it to the Union.  * Pushed for Congress to pay him the bounty, and was paid about $37,000 for it. Which is to say, "more money than a slave would likely see in five lifetimes."   * Joined the US Navy. Which is notable, because the US Navy was not admitting black sailors at this point.   * Convinced the US Army to admit black soldiers. You know. Like you do.  * Oh, did I mention that all of this happened before he turned 23? Because it all did.  * Assigned to pilot an experimental ironclad steamship in an attack on Charleston harbor. This fails. The ship sinks. Smalls is nonetheless commended for bravery.  * Reassigned to the Planter, the ship he stole less than two years ago, with some of the black crew which originally stole it. The captain of the Planter, caught in crossfire between Confederate and Union ships, attempts to surrender to the Confederates.  * Decided he's going to have none of that, because black soldiers and sailors are killed on capture. Sails the ship back to the Union lines against his captain's orders, saving the lives of his black crew.   * Commended for bravery again. And promoted. Which makes him the first black naval captain in US history. He's actually captain of the Planter, the ship he stole less than two years ago.   * The war ends.  * Used the money he got from stealing Confederate ships to buy the house he lived in when he was a slave. Moves in. Runs for Congress.  * Won.  * Kept running for Congress. Kept winning. Became the longest-serving black Congressman until the late 20th century.   * Reconstruction ended. Gerrymandering, poll violence, and the like keep him from running again.  * Stayed active in politics. Attempted to return the black vote to South Carolina. Fails, but consider that this is precisely the sort of thing which would get you lynched between the years of 1876 and 1920.  * Appointed to be customs inspector. Which, again: this is a math-heavy job, and Smalls had no formal education.   Name an important thing which a human being could have done between the Civil War and World War I, and Smalls did it. He didn't just rise up from poverty: he rose up from the most abject position an American could be consigned to, and just ... kept rising. Even after the tragedy that ended Reconstruction, he somehow managed to keep his head above water.   He died the owner of the house in which he had been a slave, serving the country which had both rewarded and betrayed him.
- Lee Kuan Yew, a brilliant mind, who (very rarely) cried at the prospect of having to abandon Chinese and Indians upon separating from Malaysia \[[YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41ND3U_9HgQ), [TW](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/873646954336727043)\], who made singapore prosperous and secure despite democracy and a very divided population.
