title: शिष्टः Role-models
---


Introduction
------------

*   A great deal of importance is seen among hindus for tradition - especially formal pedigree in terms of a chain of guru-shiShya relationships.
*   Where the shiShTa behavior is clearly in conflict with shruti etc.., it should be deprecated according to some (eg medhAtithi on manu [here](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc200283.html) ).
*   Given that the shAstra-s available to us are always incomplete, and possibly corrupted and changed to various degrees (see "Holy Books"), one might expect the behavior of shiShTa-s (role-models) to demonstrate various components of the hindu way.

Challenges
----------

*   One's shiShTa may be another's non-shiShTa. Examples:

  *   southern brAhmaNa-s violating sApiNDya prohibitions in marriage are rejected as a valid source of dharma by northerners.
  *   mAdhva account of madhva's sannyAsa casting the shAnkara tradition as Asurika \[[IMG](http://imgur.com/a/WG1Cv)\]. 

*   One can never really tell if some traditional practice or non-practice originated from some respectable lost authority (sage or text) or from weakness / laxity at some point in time.
*   It can be hard to tell exactly how role-models of the (distant) past behaved or thought.

  *   See discussion under "history".
