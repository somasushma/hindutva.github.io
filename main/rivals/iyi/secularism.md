- Alternative phrases that helps us understand secularism better
    - sickularism
    - (via [Ambreesh](https://www.facebook.com/ambreesh.mishra)) \- post-christian christianism.
    - Dechristianized christianity (bAlagangAdhara) \[[hipkapi](http://www.hipkapi.com/2011/03/03/the-religion-of-secular-state-dechristianized-christianity-s-n-balagangadhara/)\]
    - Note its close connection to modern reactionary epistemological atheism (described [here](../zombie-cult.md)).
- There is often a continuation of thought patterns of the abrahamisms. \[[JG](http://library.fora.tv/2008/05/24/John_Gray_in_Conversation)\] Examples:
    - History with a purpose, future being worse than the past, culminating in some sort of ecstatic utopia. \[Seen in millennarianism, which is ought to be accomplished by divine power, and often by war - Syria 2014, Lybia 2013, Iraq, afghAnistan.\]
    - Scorn for superstitious heathens.

## Poison to heathens

- License to proselytize and subvert puts the abrahamisms at an even greater advantage.
    - "From a human perspective an invading pathogen is abnormal; from the pathogen's perspective it's perfectly normal." –Zinsser
    - It is taken to be a license to proselytize and subvert the weakest and stupidest sections of pagan society.
    - This puts heathen traditions like hinduism and shinto at a disadvantage. To counter them, they are forced to pervert themselves and develop proselytizing arms.
    - See the [stubborn minority principle here](../../polity/external-affairs/tolerance.md).
    - This is especially true today: " there are inevitably nay-sayers, non-theists, secular-pagans and the like who pounce in proudly with “but there were non-polytheists in the ancient world too.” They will bring up pantheism, monism, atheism and the like as though this somehow strengthens their attempts to dismantle our traditions. ... I think the time has come to address some of this ideological undercutting because while what they say is technically accurate, it is presented without context and that context is important. We live in a very different world from our polytheistic ancestors. We are an occupied people. Our world is doggedly, demonstrably, and sometimes violently monotheistic. ..." \[[krasskova16](https://krasskova.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/the-battle-for-polytheisms-soul/)\]
- Equation of inimical barbarian religions with national cultural traditions.
    - Secularism fosters a false sense of equality between the national pagan culture and the barbarian abrahamisms (which are not even comparable, being as different as an orange is to a brinjal). This brings exclusivist, poisonous dogmas to the fore, and offers them deference and legitimacy.
    - The local cultural traditions obviously have contributed a lot more to the distinctiveness and the soul of the nation. Barbarian religions, by contrast, will have harmed more than enriched the national culture and security.
    - This false sense of equality spreads like fire through the minds of the unwary pagan populace - especially its idiot segments.
- Destruction of the national (and cultural) spirit by de-(spi)ritualization of government
    - State and group rituals are an essential part of pagan expression. Secularism forces this pagan cultural expression out of the public space.
        - Examples: saxony \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/582162695127994370)\], shinTo, hindus (rAjasUya etc..).
- Separation of the spiritual from the secular perverts heathen culture.
    - This separation is absent in heathen cultures. By forcing this upon them, the abrahAmists weaken and pervert heathen expression.
    - Separating artistic feeling from science
        - "This dichotomy between religiosity and secular pursuits is a feature of the dominant mode of thought in the Leukosphere arising partly out of their religion (Christendom and orthodox-jewry stand mostly at cross purposes with Science)."  \[[MT](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmanasataramgini.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F02%2F10%2Fthe-end-of-the-heathens%2F&h=iAQF6fwII&s=1)\] Part of "Secularism" then has come to mean that religiosity should be kept out of acceptable scientific discourse in general. This has been internalized by Macaulay's children.
- Universalization of a phenomenon of limited local relevance
    - "Were secularism to be seen as not only a product of the West, but also having characteristics that link it to the ongoing religious traditions of the Christian West, then its universal applicability would be questionable." \[[Mohr13](https://www.academia.edu/1549528/2_The_Christian_origins_of_secularism_and_the_rule_of_law)\]
    - History
        - Vicious internal conflicts (eg. protestants vs catholics) amongst or with the Abrahamisms led to the rise of secularism.
        - "However, the “pratyakSha” of science kept repeatedly hammering on the “pramANa” of the pretapustaka, with the final blow coming much closer to our times with the publication of the evolutionary theory by Darwin. One would have thought that this blow the pretamata would have no leg to stand on. However, even that did not eradicate the pretamata. Rather, the two apparently contradictory trajectories continued to coexist in the mlechCha world with the strengthening a concept called the separation of the secular from the sacral. This offered an opportunity for the pretamata to not just survive but even expand by pushing both its rapine secularized version that continued to engulf heathen civilizations in the name of various secular constructs and its unadulterated evangelistic form. This aspect is indeed seen by the imposition of the same kind dialog on heathen civilizations like our own wherein we are forced to cut up knowledge by separating secular from sacral \[One might look up this earlier note in this regard\]. This is followed by a trivialization of our sacral structures making it easy for the pretamata \[or for that matter the rAkShasa-mata\] to fill up the ensuing vacuum."  \[[MT](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmanasataramgini.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F02%2F10%2Fthe-end-of-the-heathens%2F&h=iAQF6fwII&s=1)\]
- Continued thought patterns that are inimical and scornful to heathens
    - Nearly all "secularism" is the result of an abrahamistic concept, which is very different from the pagan context.
    - "This meme is peculiar in many ways- it is antagonistic in its exterior to religion as defined by Christo-Islamism, but is in its interior a twin of the religion meme of Leukosphere and sustained by very similar doctrinal constructs. Most importantly their system of ethics in secularism derive directly from the core Abrahamistic meme. The scorn for heathens is also inherited..." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/09/western-generalizations-of-religiosity/)\]

## Hindu past

- An opinion in AgamADambara about what is tolerable: [SP14](https://vajrin.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/sarva-dharma-samabhava-an-astika-view/).

## sikh khAlsa

sikhism has latent abrahamist tendencies. In a way, it is proto-islamophile-secularism. Same with many baba-isms.  

- The holy texts: \[list [here](https://sites.google.com/site/samskrtamsfo/darsanam/an-yadarsanani)\]
    - Gurdas Vaar (not part of the grantha) supposedly relates the mecca visit tale too.
    - hard core khAlistanis who don't even accept dahsam granth.
- Some disturbing patterns include:
    - Equating hinduism with inimical abrahamisms
    - image worship (and many other hindu activities) are considered "superstition" - the video fits right in. (This should remind you of the anti-superstition = anti-hindu legislation of our sickular overlords). This often degenerates to active iconoclasm or tolerance of iconoclasm - (W1, [W2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry_in_Sikhism#Smiting_of_the_nose_of_Durga.27s_idol)) and mocking of hindu rituals (upanayana, tarpaNa by guru NAnak, durgA pUjA by some later guru according to some accounts).
    - Some problem shabads in the granth sahib come from Kabir.
- Yet, they are falsely protrayed as a sword arm of hinduism.
    - "Among other things, Govind assures Aurangzeb that he is just as much an idol-breaker as the Padeshah himself: “I am the destroyer of turbulent hillmen, since they are idolators and I am the breaker of idols.” Aurangzeb was sufficiently pleased with the correspondence (possibly several letters) he received from the Guru, for he ordered Wazir Khan not to trouble Govind any longer. ... So far, it is hard to see where the Sikhs have acted as the sword-arm of Hinduism against Islam. If secularism means staying on reasonable terms with both Hindus and Muslims, we could concede that the Gurus generally did steer a “secular” course. Not that this is shameful: in the circumstances, taking on the Moghul Empire would have been suicidal." \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2011/12/guru-tegh-bahadurs-martyrdom.html)11\]
- Exceptional orders, which need to be promoted at the expense of khAlistAni akAli subversive traitors.
    - arjun-deva, 5th in line after nAnaka, was pro-veda and pro-smRti. Arjan dev's shabads form the bulk of granth sahib**.**
    - udAsi-s who controlled gurudvAra-s before AkAli takeover in 1920-s.
    - sanAtan shastar vidyA \[[SV16](http://www.shastarvidiya.org/articles/misunderstandings.html)\]
- Subversion to fit the british
