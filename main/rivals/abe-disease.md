"If Hinduism is a single religion, consistency requires Judaism, Xianity & Islam be categorised as sects of a single religion" \- Stietencron  

## Fundamental incompatibility with paganisms

### Practical observations

- "National anthem, Cashmereyaut, suppression of dummy grad students etc are mere facades for the really elephant in the room that H themselves are afraid to see -- there can be no coexistence between Abe and the heathens & Abe will do all it takes to make us fertilizer for the soil." \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/762346994333519873)\]

### Philosophical divergence

- Abrahamisms have certain indispensable beliefs (dogmas), without which the thought-system would collapse. (Aksharananda [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN0JQsgZJas).)
- Common notions in Abrahamist theology (with rare exceptions)
    - creation
        - originally thought to have happened exactly as described in the book.
        - reason: unknown, but deduced to be motivated by the desire to have others like himself. Granted various beings "free will" to that they can have this "peaceful garden".
        - satan was one of the angels, who broke off and has been "poisoning" human minds since. But he is being deliberately tolerated (for some time until the end of days) in order to prove that his counsel was counterproductive - that only God knows what's good for mankind.
    - revelation (in nature AND in the book)
        - "nature reveals the handiwork of a single author".
        - Revelation in the book says \*how\* God should be worshiped. 
    - true God and false gods (supposedly unwitting followers of Satan), universal urge for religion/ divinity, religion (= worshiping the true God, rejecting false gods)
        - BG [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDNTP53TCxA), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDNTP53TCxA).
        - Also see [here](../tattvam/deva.md).
        - Hegel's excellent observation [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/TLjScks.jpg), [prospects_folk](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pc/tubingen.htm).
    - After-life, end of days and judgement
        - In the end of days, messaiah (identified with Jesus) will come back, there will be a big war and he will murder all non-believers.
        - Judgement day: All the dead will be resurrected (with body) for judgement.
            - Non-believers and evil doers will be tortured for ever. (In exceptional cults,  they just wont get a chance at second life - Eg. Jehovah's witnesses. )
        - salvation
            - salvation is reserved (but not guaranteed) for followers of (say) Christ and denied to other Pagan moral people.
                - Beyond acceptance of the main prophet's teachings, one is dependent on "God's grace" for salvation.
            - true/ false religion  [BG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzf8L3C8nZU).
- "Abrahamic Worship" vs "pUjA" distinction. [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9-bFtSKie0&index=7&list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4b3hfoUUNQ&list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD&index=12), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67KEqTYNXr8&index=13&list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0seNsxMTs&index=14&list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD)
    - Abrahamic concept of worship is supposedly more rigid - God tells you how he should be served in revelations; you cannot go worship him through idols, for example. So there  is the concept of "right worship" and "false worship".
        - By contrast, pUjA can take many forms. Consider: आकाशात् पतितं तोयं यथा गच्छति सागरम्। सर्वदेवनमस्काराः केशवं प्रति गच्छति॥
    - The famous Abrahamist objection to  goes: "Worship the creator, not the creation." Implying that one is forced to have a dichotomy between the creator and his creation in matters of worship.
        - The target of pUjA need not be Gods or deities. Does Ayudha-pUja necessarily imply in the mind of the worshipper that a Maruti Car is a God? Is such a belief even required? Even if one considers the car to be one of the places where the divine resides, this still contrasts with the notion of Abrahamic worship which would prohibit such "idolatory".
    - Belief in a certain dogma is important in worship, but not in pUjA. Christian belief is that worship of false Gods takes you to hell. 
        - pUjA is more flexible: doesn't require any fixed belief - it may only require the concept of sahRdayatA while performing the pUjA; the fact that it has to do with emotional well being rather than physical well being; that the beliefs in the bhAvanA-loka (emotional world) are separate from beliefs about the physical world.

    - "Adoration" is a better word for pUjA.
- Abrahimst concept of divine plan and importance of history: "God has a plan for everyone. To understand that, history becomes important.". Story vs history ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKqYWvviFPs&index=11&list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD)).
    - The contrast between pagan view of history and willingness to accord greater respect for past people, and the Abrahamistic concept of jahiliya ([TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/751837015478562816)).
- Conservative ability
    - Greater staticness of divine law in the Abrahamisms.
        - The laws given by the Abrahamic God in the revelations, and the dictates of the main prophet are considered inviolable. Change or deviation is not readily allowed.
        - By contrast, the hindu dharmashAstra-s are fluid and context (place/ time) dependent, encouraging giving up practices detested by the society at large. (More [here](../social-cultivation/dharma-fluid.md))
    - Prophets as a bug in the code
        - the prathamonmatta-s did recognize the link between a sādhāraṇonmatta and a prophet, although they are careful to distinguish the two. Jeremiah 29.26 states: “The lord (i.e. the eka-rākṣasa) made you a priest in place of Jehoiada, and you are now the chief officer in the temple. It is your duty to see that every man that is mad and makes himself a prophet is placed in chains with an iron collar round his neck.” ... Deuteronomy 13.2–6 gives the clear prescription regarding how this should be done: “If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke unto thee, saying, “Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them,” thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams…And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he hath spoken to turn you away from the lord your god…”  \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/unmada-carca/)\]
        - "The founder of tṛtīyonmāda realized that there was a “bug” in the formulation of the previous unmāda-s and wrote into his version of the unmāda-code that there could be no “unmatta” after him." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/unmada-carca/)\]
    - Acculturation vs heathenization tension
        - "Abrahamism has a certain internal “thermometer” which can sense whether a doctrinal patina is strategic acculturation which is good for takeover of heathens, or actually a dangerous counter-intrusion of heathenism into their own doctrine. This sensory process had been perfected in the midst of the prathamonmatta-s well before the pretācarin-s and Bardaisan. [We know that with the rise of Neo-Platonism and Hermetic traditions, prathamonmatta-s were being absorbed into syncretic or even openly Hellenistic traditions on a large-scale](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/a-greco-semitic-apollonian-ritual-and-the-heathen-assimilation-of-paleo-abrahamism/). This led a quick response where the [errant were killed or cut out](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/a-greco-semitic-apollonian-ritual-and-the-heathen-assimilation-of-paleo-abrahamism/)." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/unmada-carca/)\]
- On tolerance and evangelism:
    - Rare forms of U1, U2 and U3 proselytize broadly.
    - Common hooks:
        - Why is there suffering and "injustice" in the world? Why was man created? We have all the answers, and the world can be paradise.
    - Common reasons for failure
        - Familial, social and political resistance.
    - The urge to proselityze is motivated by:
        - The need to umulate Jesus or Mohammed as ideal abrahamists.
        - The desire to root out erroneous beliefs of people (especially with regards to God's true intents, supposedly congruous with Satan's aspersions on him) and make them have the "right belief".
            - Shreevatsa's example to contrast the nature of Abrahamist belief with Pagan belief: "You may "believe" that your spouse and children are the most wonderful in the world, and so might your colleague about their own spouse and children, but this need not necessarily lead to conflict. Maybe even though you strongly "believe" it -- and even want to believe it -- you don't think it's a claim about facts: the "belief" here is a matter of attitude, not truth. Plus there is the social contract that it is rude to try and impose this private belief of yours on others, and that it is rude to try to dissuade someone else from their belief. Nor is there is the sense that contradictory beliefs of this sort must necessarily be resolved one way or the other, or that the fact of someone else holding a contradictory belief is by itself (as opposed to via their actions) a threat to you."
        - In some cases (especially U2), facilitating the prosperity of ummah by waging war.
- Condemnation of ancestors, and effect on civilizational achievement.  
    - Other than the "chosen people" concept of jews, converts to Christianity and Islam condemn their pagan ancestors to ignorance and  hell.
    - "pride in you ancestors is IMO important for achievement as a civilization. Perhaps eventual decline of marUnmatta achievement. stems from this v. cause. OTH, the U2s have developed something called "racism" or on the other hand leftism which allows for such pride to reenter through the backdoor often with the claim of false ancestries. As for U1s their whole achievement stems stems from their mata being closely aligned with the concept of being a people whose ancestors were chosen ones." \[[TW17](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/846556225638748160)\]  
        
- Fake universalism
    - As Ketkar pointed out, Christianity can be regarded only as a tribal tradition and thus cannot lay claims to universality which is rather the domain of the Hindu dharma.

## Effects on biological fitness

- Case of Islam [here](islam/intro.md).

## History

- The Persian asura/ ahura Mazda may have been a precursor to these intolerant exclusivisms (we have Xerxes describing his destruction of the "daiva" temple-s [here](http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/XPh.html) ).
- "The process by which this came about might be described as follows: In the early tribal period each tribe would have had its own patron god; when kingship emerged the state promoted Yahweh as the national god of Israel, supreme over the other gods, and gradually Yahweh absorbed all the positive traits of the other gods and goddesses; finally, in the national crisis of the exile, the very existence of other gods was denied."
- Akenaton's Aten monotheism.

## Jewish viewpoint and roots  

- Noah's rules: "Non-Jews do not have to become Jews to become righteous. They only have to embrace the Seven Laws of Noah. According to Torah tradition, God gave Noah and his family seven commandments to observe when he saved them from the flood. These commandments, referred to as the Noachide Commandments or Laws, are learned by tradition but also suggested in Genesis Chapter 9, and are as follows: 1. Not to commit idolatry; 2. Not to commit blasphemy; 3. Not to commit murder; 4. Not to have forbidden sexual relations; 5. Not to commit theft; 6. Not to eat flesh cut from a living animal; 7. To establish courts of justice to punish violators of the other six laws..." ([YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1ve4Hs4Po))

## Common politico military expressions

- "The Habsburg monarch Karl (Charles) V saw himself as the lord of the Catholics leading them in the crusade against infidels. The tsar of Russia Ivan IV saw himself as the lord of the orthodox church leading them in their own religious war. In the Mohammedan world Suleyman was accompanied by Shah Ismail of Iran who saw himself as a jihadist for the Shia cause. Further east, Padishah Akbar saw himself as the true ghazi who was rooting out the kaffirs of Hind. The trajectory each of these took was to set the tune of history to this date. " \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/09/23/turushkanam-madhyahna/)\]

### Intra-monotheistic alliances

- Macaulay quote [TW16](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/545075128212926464), [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/1suiK1p.png).
- muslim-christian alliances
    - Turkey
        - [NR16](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438084/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkey-coup-aftermath).
- Judaist-muslim alliances
    - "Having survived the battery at the hands of the Christian holy warrior Janos Hunyadi, the Osmans recovered and expanded again under Bayazid-II. In course of his reign he brought many Judaists who had been evicted from Spain and settled them in the Osman empire, resulting a deep alignment between them and the Mohammedans. ... Nevertheless, he settled several Jews in the region and they had a symbiotic relationship with him as he appointed one of them as his dentist and others as financial helpers." \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/22/turning-of-the-turkic-wheel-unmattabhisa%E1%B9%83dhi-battles-won-battles-lost-and-march-of-marunmada/)\]

## Hindu response

- Military response - see [here](../polity/external-affairs/defence.md).
    - [MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/) posits: "Mohammedanism needed special backing for its effective survival in the subcontinent. ... Demographic and missionary aggression by Mohammedanism might not have been sufficient for it to overrun the Hindu dharma."
        
- "The striving for non-Hinduness might have even lead to internal rifts within Mohammedanism as each group was trying be more Mohammedan than the other. " \[[MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)\]

### Attacks on the Abrahamisms at an intellectual level.

#### Muted inquiry into the Abrahamisms

In classical Indian literature "the Muslims, who were not only present in India for many centuries, but were its actual rulers, appear only in vague and marginal references" (HALBFASS 1988: 182); "the Sanskrit tradition has never taken official notice of the existence of Islam" (ERNST 1992: 30); "I would lay stress on this - the religious identity of the Central Asians \[who invaded India\] is not once thematized in Sanskrit sources" (POLLOCK 1993: 286). 

#### Intelligent critiques

A few Hindu-s did understand and produce some very high-quality critiques of Abrahamistic thought. For example, we have a 9th century apostate of Islam, Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Ishak al-Rawandi, quoting barAhima (or brAhmaNa-s) of al-hind:  

“_If prophets are sent to preach adherence to things that can be established by the use of intellect then the prophets are just like ordinary people. If, of the other hand, they come to preach what contradicts those things – god has made those things to be perceived as proofs; they will not suit anything else except through the altering/perversion of the intellect itself._”  

Other reports:

- Judaist Dawood ibn Marwan \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/751268220527489025/photo/1)\]
- Ancient judaist claim to priority \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/751276710968954881/photo/1)\]

In the 19th century, we see excellent critiques by dayananda sarasvatI and [arumuka nalavAr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arumuka_Navalar) \- and to some extant by vivekAnanda.

#### Kalachakra Tantra

From [Heid1998](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8878/2785): In Sanskrit literature the Kalacakra tantra is unique in presenting a fairly comprehensive and quite accurate portrayal of Islamic beliefs and practices. \[[WP](https://vishvasvasuki.wordpress.com/2015/06/08/portrayal-of-muslims-in-kalachakra-tantra/)\]

#### Heathenizing Abrahamists

- There was some extra-military response to Islam during muslim reign \[[MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)\], involving conversion of muslims, apostacies of Akbar and Dara Shukoh etc..
    - Apostasy of Akbar: [MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/) and [B](http://bharatendu.com/2009/07/06/akbar-transition-5/).
- Tuglaq times: " brAhmaNa of Delhi had constructed a wooden seal on which were engraved the pictures of Hindu deities. Large numbers of Hindus resorted to his house to worship the seal. He had also converted Moslem women to the Hindu polytheism." [MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)
- mahArAShTra: "In mahArAShTra the influencing and conversion of Moslems by Hindu religious figure is recorded into the 1600s of CE – e.g. an enigmatic female shaiva teacher who was active in this regard in the Adilshahi territory of the 1600s. In south India we hear of the great bhAskararAya makhIndra converting a Turkic woman to the Hindu fold in the 1700s. " \[[MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)\]
- vanga-desha
    - maa bonbibi (= mulsimified forest deity vanadevI durgA) of the sundarban-s [IFC15](http://infochangeindia.org/environment/features/maa-bonbibi-in-the-land-of-tigers.html).

#### Resistance to conversion

The Hindu identity provides some resistance from pressure to convert to Abrahamisms.

- Relatively more successful resistance to Christianity in Manipur (which is 46% Hindu, compared with a small minority in Nagaland \[[History](https://vishvasvasuki.wordpress.com/2015/07/03/shifting-from-manupur-to-nagaland-christian-missionaries-resisted-by-vaishnavism/)\].

#### Reconversion

- Hindu law:
    - Reconversion to the hindu ethos was codified in the devala-smRti \[[PVK_IMG1](https://imgur.com/8ZlWt2a), [TW17](https://twitter.com/vajrayudha11/status/865964633894649856)\] and Vignaneswara’s commentary to Yagyavalkya Smriti \[[S](http://swarajyamag.com/culture/caste-is-hardly-an-impediment-for-homecoming-hindus/)\].
- In Practice:
    - \[Some Aspects of Ancient Indian Culture, by DR Bhandarkar, Rev. JM Anthos, Asian Educational Services, 1989. pp 68.\] quotes an incident in 1398-99 CE during the Vijayanagara era, in which 2,000 Brahmin girls of a village were rescued from the armies of Firoz Shah Bahmani and accepted after purification rites \[1\].
    - "The Shuddhi movement of Arya Samaj, carried to many parts of the north in the early decades of 1900s by Swami Shraddhananda, is nothing but a continuation of this long-time Hindu practice."

#### Problematic immunity and the idiot baba-s.

- While Muslims and Christians did some comparitive study of Hindu civilization and culture, the Hindu-s did not reciprocate - at least not in equal volume. Rather, many Hindu-s made idiotic and misleading statements such as "All religions are equal. You can be a good Hindu by being a good Muslim or Christian".
- Kanchi MahasvamI produced foolishness that claimed crazy stuff such as "all religions are the same", "ramses and rama are related", "aztec is probably a corrpution of Astika" etc.. ([1](http://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/articles/Jagadguru%20Divya%20Chareitram%20Hindu%20Culture%20from%20Egypt%20to%20Java%20English.html)).
    - But, a mitigating factor: "the AchArya was not a svayaM-devatA-vAdin & upheld the deva-dharma sincerely despite certain serious idiosyncratic misapprehensions".
- Criticism
    - Swami Aksharananda (Guyana) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFJKQdhXzvo).

####   
Rousing fight to expel the Abrahamist threat

- "Make the people one; fill their minds with the single thought of resisting the Mleccha enemy..." - Samarth Ramdas's letter advising Sambhaji. \[ [K1](http://kalchiron.blogspot.com/2014/06/advice-by-ramdas-swamy-to-sambhaji.html)\]  
    
- "He (Vijayanagara ruler) commanded the Brahmins to deliver every day to the troops discourses on the meritoriousness of slaughtering the Mohammedans, in order to excite zeal for expelling them. He ordered them to describe the butchery of cows, the insults to sacred images, and destroying of temples, practiced by the true believers." - Ferishta \[[GB](http://books.google.com/books?id=TQZUAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=He+ordered+them+to+describe+the+butchery+of+cows,+the+insults+to+sacred+images,+and+destroying+of+temples,+practised+by+the+true+believers.&source=bl&ots=ISgEDXrpCx&sig=zv0le6LRnc6EasJjjV5kEmzejCw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Edq8U4qJDdbpoASP04HwDg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=He%20ordered%20them%20to%20describe%20the%20butchery%20of%20cows%2C%20the%20insults%20to%20sacred%20images%2C%20and%20destroying%20of%20temples%2C%20practised%20by%20the%20true%20believers.&f=false)\].

### Solidarity with other pagans/ polytheists.

- During the Yazidi massacre: Ravishankar gave aid.
- Assistance to Heraka of Nagaland : [see here](https://vishvasvasuki.wordpress.com/2015/07/04/hindu-influence-on-the-heraka-zeme-of-nagaland/).
