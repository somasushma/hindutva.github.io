title: Negationism
---
  

## Intro

(Such negationism should be equal to "holocaust-denial".)  

- Examples
    - In the Ram Mandir/ Babri masjid case, several "scholars" made shoddy claims.
    - Several scholars such as Llewelyn Morgan \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2012/07/a-denier-on-temple-destruction.html)\] and Eaton (Koenraad Elst's Eaton [rebuttal](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/ayodhya/eaton.html)) have been temple-destruction deniers. 
    - Note: at [38:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Zfxn9lNfiL8#t=38m01s) in this National Geographic documentary, they say: "These statues did not loose their heads by accident... What the Hindu priests started, muslim invaders completed." Equating Hindu priests and Muslim invaders is vile deception. There is no evidence supporting the hypothesis that Hindu priests "beheaded statues".
- Theories on whence this might arise:
    - Criticizing Islam means criticizing their own Christian past - fundamental problems are the same.
    - To modern Europeans, the fundamental evils of intolerant Abrahamisms (Eg. Banu Quraiza massacre) are abstract concepts, as are Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Juno and the emperor Julian. The Aurangzebs, Mahmuds and Aladins (ie their early Christian equivalents) of Europe are about as abstract as the forgotten Roman Gods. Not so for us culturally rooted Hindus. IshAna still lives in our rage, Indra in our stength, Earth in our body and so on. I only need to travel 150 kilometers from my hometown to see temples rendered to ruins by the eununch ghAzi mallik kafur, not too much farther are Hampi and Srirangam. Similarly, one does not often find Italians being murdered or roughed up by hooligans partly motivated by Islam, but we do.

## Negationist claims and tricks

- Hide the context trick:
    - "In the TED Talk by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie that I posted last week, she notes that if you want to dispossess a people, start with “Secondly.” In other words, if you want to dispossess Native Americans, don’t start telling the story with the incursions and violence of European invaders, start with the arrows shot by Native warriors and make it look as though it was without provocation. If you want to dispossess polytheistic Hindus, start with the statue in the mosque, not the appropriation of a site of Hindu reverence. The way a story is told matters." \[[krasskova16](https://krasskova.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/the-battle-for-polytheisms-soul/)\]
- Hindu iconoclasm technique
    - Claim: Hindu and other pagan kings did it to their temples too! 
        - See [here](../../polity/external-affairs/tolerance.md).
    - Claim: "The reverse happened too."
        - Lots of old mosques are now Gurdwaras in Punjab".
    - "Lots of old mosques are now Gurdwaras in Punjab".
        
        - Above claim is unverified.
        - The mosques in question were abandoned. "After the Partition of undivided India, Muslims who were in majority in the area, left for Pakistan. Hundreds of mosques were left unattended. Now these mosques have either been destroyed by savagery of times or are under personal control of people who later occupied them." \[milligazette [artcile](http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15042002/1504200294.htm)\]
        
        - "Hindu kings of Vijayanagar (Rama Raya) and by Aurangzeb appropriated some of the Shia ones as stables for his horses".
- Muslim patronage technique
    - Claim: Muslim kings patronized and protected hindu centers of worship... "Such actions in effect projected a hierarchy of hybridised political and religious power that descended downward from the Mughal emperor to his mansabdar, from the mansabdar to the god Jagannath and his temple, from Jagannath to the sub-imp erial king who patronised the god, and from the king to his subjects."( [Eaton](http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1725/17250620.htm))
        
        - So, the priorities of the mlechCha emperors (who were not apostates of the semitic memes) were: a\] Power b\] Islam .
            - Where they could pursue \[b\] without hurting \[a\], they did that with a relish.
        
        - Otherwise, they desisted. This is why we have shah jahAn riding in a charriot beside jagannAtha, and tippu sultan (among other mulsim rulers \[A history of Sringeri - Tonnemane, A K Shastry [SG](http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/108135/9/09_chapter%205.pdf)\]) writing love letters to shringeri ascetics while going about the anti-hindu business elsewhere.
        - Specific examples of patronage:
            - Tipu Sultan
                - Patronage
                    - "An idea of the number of Tipu's religious endowments across his realm can be gained by looking at the registers held in the Kozhikode Archives in Kerala. The records show that Tipu authorised sixtyseven grants of rent-free land, primarily to temples and mosques, solely for the taluks of Calicut, Ernad, Bettathnad and Chowghat. If we extrapolate that figure across the entire realm, it is clear that his patronage of such institutions was extensive," \[[BS16](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/legend-of-tipu-gets-a-new-context-book-review-116073100149_1.html)\] 
                    - "Kate's book is a good one but I do not think that it is very objective with (some of ) Tipus religious policies. Some of his policies were accompanied with virulent anti-Hindu bias. ... Regarding his endowments to Chowghat & Calicut temples, that is definitely true and can be seen in the Inam register. Extrapolated to the rest of kerala where he ruled, the number of temples that received official largesse under his rule were definitely large in number. There were a couple  of churches among them too. The number of mosques were relatively few...  I see no sense in tipu rewarding 2 temples separated by say 15 miles and pillaging several in between. In fact many temples mentioned in the Inam register are untraceable today. The local legend about the Parur church says it was ransacked by tipu but inam register mentions grant of land to parur church by tipu. So i will take many deaecration stories with a grain of salt. Many not all as   temple desecrations did happen and many are documented in contemporary accounts too. ... The Moplahs who rose in rebellion twice after tipus vacating malabar were respobsible  for many of the mischiefs. " - Nidhin Ollikara
                - Temple Destruction
                    - Despite patronizing temples on the one hand, is it not true that Tipu personally ordered or urged demolition of some temples (as nidhin acknowledges in his blog)? Is it not true that he never ordered a mosque's destruction?
                    - "Varaha temple, a symbol of the Wodeyars, was razed to the ground." \[[BS16](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/legend-of-tipu-gets-a-new-context-book-review-116073100149_1.html)\]
                    - A few cases are listed in \[[SB17](http://prekshaa.in/tipu-sultan-temple-destroyer-par-excellence/?relatedposts_hit=1&relatedposts_origin=7752&relatedposts_position=2#.WgIeXz6nFhE)\].
                - Contemporary analysis
                    - How does a modern arm-chair historian presume to understand Tipu contrary to contemporary hindu leaders' clear candid statements?
                    - "Tipu’s moves are not good. He is full of arrogance. Recently Nur Muhammad received a letter from Tipu that he converted 50,000 Hindus including women and children to Islam, no Padishah or Vazir did it in the past, with God’s grace he could. He converts entire villages.’-Letter from Nana Phadnis to Mahadji Scindia, 5 September 1784.
                    -  Further, sources reveal that 1791 showed a marked change in Tipu's approach to temples and Brahmins when faced with an all round attack. "Due to past excesses, Tipu’s vakeels were denied an audience by the Maratha chiefs in the run up to the siege of Srirangapatnam. The Maratha letter writers remark on Tipu’s acts as they were uncharacterisitic of him." quotes Uday S Kulkarni. \[[SW15](https://swarajyamag.com/culture/what-exactly-happened-at-sringeri-math-in-april-1791/)\]
    - Protection from deadly Mongols canard.
        - Falsehood: By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north." Ludden, D. (13 June 2002), India and South Asia: A Short History
        - And as far as the great Mongols (those not subverted by the Religion of Peace like Mughals and Timurids)- why, they were our great friends and students. If they were to have invaded India, we would have been treated the way they treated Tibet. (Manasatarangini on Hamira-deva.)
- "It was about power, not religion" technique
    - Claim: "Muslim iconoclasm practiced against indigenous religions in India was almost always done as a result of state sponsorship to establish political supremacy over regions conquered or subjected, and not as a matter of religions conviction in a intolerant, monotheistic faith that received divine sanction to triumph over other, apparently lesser or antithetical, ones. The primary structures of Hindu and Muslim religious architecture, the temple and the mosque, have had a fundamental difference almost since their inception: the major Hindu temples of a kingdom housed the kuladevata, or the divinity of the race/clan, of which the acting king was but a regent. .. depredations were resorted chiefly to annul the visible symbols of Hindu political power."
        - Why would muslim iconoclasm in India differ so much from muslim iconoclasm elsewhere (Recall the Sphynx in egypt, buddha-s of bAmiyAn, yazidi shrines in sinjAr)?
        - How did hindu conquest of other hindu kingdoms not need similar destruction of "kuladevatA-s"?
        - Numerous Muslim rulers and their chroniclers described themselve-s as ghAzi-s motivated by Islam. Why doubt them? (eg: [paThAnkoT15](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Your-son-has-killed-two-kafirs-I-slit-their-throats-with-a-dagger/articleshow/50829483.cms?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=TOI))
        - Why were mosques built by muslim rivals not destroyed with equal frequency, since they were also "symbols of the previous dynasty's power"?
    - audrey truschke's claim paraphrased:
        - "Awrangzeb distanced himself from Hindu practices because he hated his brother dArA shikoh who liked them.", in contrast with contemporary Saqi Khan's Maasir i Alamgiri, where hatred for hindu practices is clearly mentioned as the cause \[[IMG](http://i.imgsafe.org/3263e5893d.jpg)\].
        - "Why did Aurangzeb ban Holi? Because Holi encourages theft!" \[[IMG](http://i.imgsafe.org/e0b9fbd12b.jpg)\]  
            
    - Muslim kings destroyed mosques as well.
        - This is a rare rexception rather than the rule.
        - Aurangzeb destroying Jama Masjid at Golconda
            - "Aurangzeb laid a siege to Golconda which lasted for more than eight months. More importantly, the vassal had stashed a huge cache of diamonds under the mosque. Aurangzeb ordered its demolition to retrieve the cache. It was not out of political or religious motive. Eight months of siege depletes the treasury and unless Aurangzeb retrieved the cache he wouldn't have been able to pay his jihadi army."
- "hindu heroes were actually ok with muslim kings. it is just the modern hindutva crowd." technique
    - audrey truschke paraphrased: "shivAjI did not successfully join Awrangzeb's court because he did not know court manners." \[[IMG](http://i.imgsafe.org/32ca400af5.jpg)\]
        - "His main intent of going to the fiend's liar @ Agra was to temporarily gain access to use their vast resources to smash his 2 old foes Adil shAh and Qutb shAh" \[[TW](https://twitter.com/ColonelGerard/status/834458173192802304)\]
