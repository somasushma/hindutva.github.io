"I increasingly see "Indology" as a Western defense against the impact of Indian thought which was being felt in late 18th-early 19th c." - Edward Butler.  

## Context

- The purpose of this list is to note the reasons why Hindus must engage with Western Indology with great caution.
    - AIDS tells us that a compromised immune system can be a fatal liability.
- **A summary**
    - From [SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/culture/much-ado-about-plagiarism-fox-vs-malhotra/): " It is not so much Malhotra, the scholar, who is worrisome to them as Malhotra, the strategist. Among the Hindus, he appears to be the first who has approached the Western academy as a knowledge-producing ‘industry.’ At least this is what I have gathered from his speeches and writings. Just like any company which builds and markets a product, the Western academy is in the business of generating and selling certain narratives. The knowledge of other cultures is collected as “raw data” from its native informants who subsequently do not play much of a role in its interpretation. This data is then subjected to hermeneutical processes based entirely on Western theories. The end result undergoes critical review processes and is packaged with notes, cross-references, bibliographies, the whole she-bang, to produce a ‘representation’ which is then admitted as authoritative knowledge on the particular subject both in the West and tragically in the host country as well."

### Modes of engagement

- Principle
    - Even if greater disengagement from western indology results in less vigorous study of hindu past in the short term, it will at least be on strong foundations.
    - Genuine and honest Hindu/ sanskrit scholarship does not need the shelter of academia to emerge.
        - There are religious institutions, rich circles of connoisseurs form around local experts in the shAstra-s.
- Examples of foolish engagement
    - Bad funding: Various idiot rich hindu-s funding sanskrit/ hindu chairs and projects which are liable to be under the influence of anti-hindu academics.
        - Rohan Murthy's funding of [www.murtylibrary.com](http://www.murtylibrary.com/) MCLI .
        - Various endowed chairs and visiting professorships
            - Indian ministry of culture Uchicago 2012 ([UC](http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2012/01/24/new-chair-indian-studies-commemorate-hindu-spiritual-leader)).
            - Ramakrishnan Professorship 2016 [UC](http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2016/01/26/ramakrishnan-professorship-support-study-sanskrit).
    - Acquiescing to sepoy-dom (explained below).
- Possibly better engagement
    - Good funding: Fund deserving pro-hindu scholars directly (in India or abroad).
    - Drive up awareness about bad Indology and anti-hindu political activism. Make them pay a professional cost.
        - Examples
            - 2016 anti-pollock campaign.
                - rAjiv malhotra's Battle for sanskrit campaign.

### Limitations on this critique

- This is not to deny the positive contribution and truly objective scholarship of some western academics towards the understanding of Hindu past and Hindu nationalism. Yet, we Hindus have shown ourselves to be internally capable of doing all this, and the subversive actions do stand out as a liability.
- Western academic setup also includes Indians trained in and beholden to that system.
- This list does not excuse shoddy research, bad presentation and bad behavior by some Hindu-s.
    - Eg. Koenraad Elst on NS Rajaram in 2014 [here](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2014/02/what-have-i-done-2.html), Rajaram reviewing unread books [KE14](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2014/04/rajaram-witzel-and-racism.html).
    - These Hindu noise makers have contributed to our defeat in the past (eg. 2005 California Textbook [KE10](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2013/10/hindu-noise-makers.html).)

## Sources of the misrepresentation

- The general dry-scholar vs practitioner problem
    - "Wanting to appear smart/ score an academic point" types tend to miss the forest for the woods, and (many a time, unfortunately) tend to make others fall into the same pattern. In contrast, a practitioner keeps looking for the \*heart\* of the issue (in the way that affects/ affected practice and the truth). So, this petty desire to show how smart they are motivates the former, not a truly noble desire to attain a sense of Atma+abhyudaya.
        - "Rather they play a game similar to what Aristotle is said to have taught Alexander – eristics – something the Macedonian warrior is said to have enjoyed. In eristics you can successively take either side of an argument and argue for it being the correct one. Similarly, members of this cluster, who are particularly common in elite American academia, can take up a viewpoint and argue for it without really being interested in investigating the truth – seemingly it is an intellectual game for their high IQs. At the long end of history much of this cluster can be seen as making little lasting intellectual contribution beyond creating ferment in their times." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/in-the-gray-zone/)\]
        - This is compounded by the fashion of being deliberately irreverent in their scholarly rhetoric as a way of indicating membership with the mlecCha Indology system.
        - Example: The "ironic" twist to hammIra-kAvya [YT16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPV8CpV1bSc#t=15).
    - So, the representation of Hindu traditions by dry scholars tends to be maddeningly flawed (whether in their textbooks, books or talks). Practitioners on the other hand are more reliable. But a \*scholarly practitioner\* is the best. This is the difference between शुष्क-पण्डितता and आर्द्रमना ऋषिः.
        - Analogies: How valuable (to insiders or outsiders) are books about making Indian music or dancing, if written by one who does not do either?
        - Some famous examples of scholar practitioners: [Robert Thurman](https://www.facebook.com/Robert.A.F.Thurman?hc_location=ufi), M Hiriyanna, shatavadhanI gaNesh, [Pandurang Vaman Kane](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pandurang-Vaman-Kane/109228925762949?hc_location=ufi), monastics and scholars associated with n traditional institutions in India and abroad, Dalai Lama.
        - Examples: \[duties vs rights ??\].
        - उक्तं खलु भगवत्पादशङ्करैः"सर्वशास्त्रवित् असम्प्रदायवित् मूर्खवदुपेक्षणीय" इति। 
    - jIva-gosvAmin's criterion - [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/mTJIsQD.png).
    - Limitations
        - This is not to deny that the labor of the dry-scholars is slightly useful to the scholarly practitioners.
        - Misconceptions arising from dry scholarship often need to be countered by similarly dry scholarship.
            - Analogy: You use a thorn to remove a thorn. But why go stepping into a field of thorns (if your intention is to seek a good representation of hindu traditions - say to guide your practice or to compose a textbook)?!! Of course, if your intention is something else, by all means, go find the thorns - just know that what you will find are mostly thorns.
            - Eg. Koenraad Elst's counters to Eaton's negationism on Islamic iconoclasm.
    - An analysis of western scholar practitioners in Hinduism: fewer scholars openly declare their hindu practice compared to buddhism \[[AC16](https://www.academia.edu/11637543/Asymmetrical_Religious_Commitments_Religious_Practice_Identity_and_Self-Presentation_among_Western_Scholars_of_Hinduism_and_Buddhism)\].
- The nature of the "social sciences" academic establishment
    - "They also know that holding (or at least uttering) the required opinions can make or break an academic career: either formally, as when a non-Anglican could not get admission to Oxford University, or informally, as under the reign of progressivist conformism today. To think highly of the academic world presupposes a link between scientific achievement and academic rank, and this largely makes sense in the exact sciences. In the humanities, especially in the social “science” and literature departments, this link is also deduced, but only as a parasitical extension of the conventions in the exact sciences. Much of what passes for scholarship these days is only ideology wrapped into jargon." \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]
- Inherent flaws in the philological methodology, where
    - the scholar tries to imagine the historical and social context prevelant at the time of composition of a text \[[YT17](https://youtu.be/edQr4IJQuEg?t=428)\]
    - rAjIva malhotra says that sheldon pollock and co have invented "political philology" - "A central argument he advocates with evangelical zeal is that Indian texts must be studied not for legitimate spiritual/sacred content, but for the purpose of finding the social exploitation and political domination contained in them. Before he can show the texts to be political, he has to devalue (and debunk) the legitimacy of the sacred dimension; then he can substitute the political motive as the reason for the successful spread of Sanskrit. ...  If one side of the coin of Pollock’s interpretation is political philology, the other side is liberation philology. ... While political philology is used to diagnose, liberation philology is used to liberate the Indian masses from the diseases being carried in their sanskriti for thousands of years." 
- Gross bungling of primary sources - interpreting them in crazy ways. Eg. Sheldon Pollock \[[YT17](https://youtu.be/vaRCmUwpmNk?t=334)\]
- Severe lack of contextual knowledge, leading to crazy (yet vehement) extrapolations.
    - The typical indologist's evaluation of (even modern, let alone ancient) India can be silly, condescending and demeaning? Just take [this](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2016-March/042887.html) recent example.
- "Intellectual yet idiot" phenomenon
    - More [here](../iyi/intro.md).
- Abrahamist and political sympathies, and the victor writes history phenomenon.
    - Examples elsewhere
        - Junipero Serra canonization [G2015](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/22/pope-grant-sainthood-brutal-missionary).
    - The abrahamist scaffolding may be nearly impossible to completely overcome. Example: Mark Dyzchowski ([TW1](https://twitter.com/Vajrakila/status/706496656942891009))
    - History of the system
        - "Area Studies began after WWII as a program to encourage university-level training and research (apparently previously largely neglected) into non-Western areas of the world for the purpose of responding to the threat of communist expansion as well as the consequences of the collapse of the British empire and other colonial systems. Starting from 1956, the US government under Title Sixth of the Higher Education Act funds 125 university-based area studies units. UC Berkeley’s South Asia area studies program, for instance, receives $3.5 million/year. In its Cold War form, area studies was intended as an extension of the US foreign policy and the work of both the CIA and the State Department—this is not a conspiracy theory, but commonly acknowledged and debated among scholars themselves. Much of the study of India’s history, religion and present society takes place within South Asia area studies, with its legacy focus on politics, economics, social injustice and conflict." - arumuganAthasvAmin.
- An anti-hindu pro-western civilizational bias.
    - Examples from history of mathematics resulting in dismissal, derision: [rAma\_pi\_16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam2rZos5Zo#t=74).
    - This was starkly evident in the early days: [MT_TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/707818465801986048/photo/1).
    - "Orientalist attitude toward India that American academics have inherited from the 19th century European scholars—it’s the working principle that the “natives” are incapable of understanding their own culture as famously explained in Edward Said’s book, Orientalism." - AR.
- Academic arrogance and rigid unwillingness to change wrong opinions.

## Revulsion towards Hindutva

One can observe within and without social media how people vilify hindutva (for example by sharing such rot \[insert link\]). They will do everything they can to make 卍 look like 卐. One must ask oneself how much one's welfare coincides with theirs.

  

The tactics a typical western politically active indologist (eg. Sheldon Pollock) uses are- 

- He plays bad cop when it comes to an assertive and virile hindu civilization. Not even disguised under the thin veneer of smooth talk is the argument for Hindus not dominating India: So that what's left may be lapped up by RoP and RoL. Eg. [Trushcke16](http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/News-Analysis/2016-04-06/Mughal-rulers-patronised-Sanskrit-literature-took-up-Persian-translations-of-Hindu-epics/219377#.VwWooIkdMe0.facebook).
- He plays good cop and advocates for hindu (nay "South asian", "ancient Indian" oh anything but "hindu") civilization, as long as it is as a neutered pet subservient to his western (ie. abrahamistic / hebraic) ideals.

### The guise of being "center"/ mainstream.

"Coming to contents, Truschke accuses “Hindu Right-wingers” of attacks on “academics”. I would have expected them to attack “anti-Hindu Left-wingers”, and indeed I learn that this is exactly how they see it,-- and how they see her. If she doesn’t like being characterized this way, she is herewith invited to stop calling her adversaries similar names. The binary Left/Right is at least problematic here, yet for a quarter century I have seen this scheme used to explain matters. Except that the Left doesn’t call itself Left: it treats itself as the natural centre, and anything to its right is deemed politically coloured: “Right” or very easily “extreme Right”." \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]

  

#### Sepoy hindus

"As the case of Malhotra has amply exemplified, it suffices to stand up as a Hindu, or to own up Hinduism, in order to be dubbed “Hindu Rightist”, “Hindutva ideologue”, as well as “fanatic”. “rookie” and all the fair names Hindus have been called by Prof. Truschke’s august school of thought. To them, the acceptable Hindu, or what Malhotra calls a “sepoy”, is one who never identifies as a Hindu, but rather as “Indian” (or better, “Bengali”, “Malayali” etc.), “low-caste”, and ideologically “secularist”. The exception is when countering criticism from self-identified Hindus, for then, he is expected to say: “But me too, I am a Hindu!” That way, he can fulfil his main task: as long as there are Hindus, he must deny them the right to speak on behalf of Hinduism and to give it a presence at the conversation between worldviews."\[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]

### Revulsion towards dharmashAstra-s and dharma

- Sheldon Pollock - [TW16](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scW5CxCj7ylkDOSpmsWQrgSFA_C5FKqqviISk6o7ESI/pubhtml#).

### Hindu-baiting in various forms

"The use of the term Hinduphobia is predicated upon the already existing acceptance and use of the term Islamophobia. If the UN, the governments of the US and EU etc., and the pan-Islamic pressure group OIC, were to give up this ugly and vicious term, then the Hinduphobia term so disliked by Truschke would lapse with it and get replaced again by the older and more accurate term Hindu-baiting."\[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]

#### Vilification of popular sanskrit vitalization

- "Apparently according to Dr. Stella Sandahl, Samskrita revivalists are interested in “cutting throats”, “raping nuns”, “destroying mosques”, etc. This preposterous and extremely offensive allegation was made in an academic e-list no less, eliciting a couple of muted protests. ... we find one Dr. Maheswaran Nair positing that Samskrita speakers are wannabe mass-murderers. ... Prof. Sheldon Pollock in an interview (available on youtube) also made some comments against the spoken Samskrita movement, though he was relatively subdued. His thesis being what I indicated earlier – spoken Samskrita doesn’t do justice to a language of high intellectual output." \[[IN08](https://vishvasvasuki.wordpress.com/2015/07/15/some-indologists-wrt-spoken-sanskrit-and-hindutva-2008-threads/), FB\]
- Consider this [excellent comment](http://www.economist.com/comment/2012367#comment-2012367) by Shreevatsa R in response to an article in the Economist, calling out statements such as: "Sanskrit has played an outsized role in India’s linguistic development", "Sanskrit’s position of prestige also allowed it to infiltrate the vocabularies of unrelated languages" - displaying an "infiltration" of opinion (in this case value judgements about what size Sanskrit \*ought\* to have, whether it ought to enrich other languages) in the midst of facts.

#### De-hinduification and South-Asia-ification.

- The "South Asia Studies Faculty" has an obvious vested interested in promoting the increased use of the term "South Asia" (the brand their academic discipline goes by) at the cost of the more familiar and accurate references to the people and culture involved.
- Response to South Asianists
    - "The term "South Asia" to describe the Indian subcontinent became current and began to be used widely after the US state department and some lawmakers instituted the "South Asia bureau" in 1991/ 1992, carving it out of the the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs." 
    - As shrI Arumuganathaswami said in response to South Asianist letter in the 2015 CA textbook hearings: "They even include deleting “India”—a name used for thousands of years in one form or another from Europe to China--in favor of “South Asia”, a modern geopolitical term, and effectively erasing one of the world’s great classical civilizations. It would be like renaming Greek studies, “South Balkan Peninsula Studies.”"

## Misrepresentation of the \*core\* of hindu ethos, subversion of hindu psyche-s

What is the core? Not the likes of the following, since hindus themselves make many such mistakes:

- Mistakes in the metropolitan museum of art (met museum NY) [tw14](https://twitter.com/kashcit/status/504950663865196544).
- Ridiculous translations from the Clay series brought out by Mr Pollock and co, arising from shaky grounding in Indian thought - [TW16](https://twitter.com/suhasm/status/705307611630014464).

###   

### Consequences

- These dry/ context-free scholars have tended to influence (very actively or otherwise) how Hindu traditions are summarized or presented to Hindus and non-hindu-s alike. Eg. The California case.
- \[To be edited.\] Casting pro-hindutva people as fools (while deliberately ignoring savants on the hindutva side).
- Subversion of the sikh-s by Max Arthur Macauliffe \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/609722130368888832)\].
    - Abrahamized the sikhs even more.
    - Invented pro-british fake prophesies.

### Books

- Plenty are books produced by western Indologists and their acolytes which have attempted or inadvertently tended to subvert Hindu traditions with inimical narratives.
    - Hindu reviews site: [here](http://hindureview.com/author/vishalagarwal/).
    - Vishal Agarwal's review of Wendy Doniger's "The Hindus: An Alternative History" : [AM10](http://smile.amazon.com/review/R15O4GR4A5HABO?sa-no-redirect=1).
    - In “The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology", Wendy Doniger presents a strange gross juxtaposition of ideas from various purANa-s, in a sly attempt to aid the claim that hindu-s popularly think that men are brahma's turds (which is contrary to the purANa-s she cites). \[[V](http://www.vigilonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2103&Itemid=1), [TW](https://twitter.com/kashcit/status/686446347948408832)\]
    - Early Indological work was heavily motivated by Evangelism.
        - Eg: The Monier-Williams / Max Muller race.
    - Imputing flawed racist narratives.
        - Prof. George Thompson on kRShNa ([KE12](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2012/04/george-thompson-as-case-study-in-racist.html))
    - Robert Goldman: "The perverted man who compared the expansion of Hanuman to the erection of a flaccid phallus. Wants to down-size the Ramayana to put the uppity Hindus in place." ([IMG](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FCeJ9kcK.png&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFsn6yE_EpMuOOj-J1_7Zor9czImQ), [IMG2](http://i.imgur.com/V3h2yRT.png), [BVP](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/3WjZziSAEGo), [TW1](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/995138594963705861)).

### In Education

- 2005 California Textbook controversy
    - Problems
        - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_textbook_controversy_over_Hindu_history). Changes finally accepted: [CA](http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/ag/ag/documents/hssnotice022706a1.pdf), [archive](https://archive.org/details/2005CaliforniaTextbookFightCorrectionsAdapted).
        - CA textbooks hearing 2015: Omission of women \[[YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0f2iCtW9BA&feature=player_embedded)\], caricature of caste \[[YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7zt4LtBh8&feature=youtu.be)\]
        - A presentation on what is taught about Hindu-s in textbooks (Hinduism Today [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n9P59Y3z5U#t=1095)).
    - Witzel, Pollock and many others launched a successful, concerted attempt to subvert positive changes brought to the coverage of the Hindu ethos in California textbooks. Witzel's congradulatory 2005 letter [here](https://vishvasvasuki.wordpress.com/2015/07/15/sampling-from-indologist-subversion-during-the-2005-california-textbook-fight/), where he next plans to target BBC.
    - Strategic errors on the Hindu side:
        - [KE10](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2013/10/hindu-noise-makers.html): " So, when in 2005 the school textbooks in California came up for review, two Hindu organizations proposed a series of edits to the chapter on Hinduism. Some were uncontroversial, e.g. replacing the photograph of a mosque with the caption "Hindu temple" by the photograph of a proper Hindu temple. Some were cases of intra-Hindu infighting, e.g. replacing the philosophical "self-realization" as the goal of Hinduism with the devotional "God-realization". Outsiders who took an interest in this, could have an opinion on this, but it was not serious enough to warrant interference. But when Hindus proposed that "the Aryan Invasion Theory is wrong" and "nobody believes in it anymore", a revolutionary c.q. a plainly wrong statement, this alerted a number of Hindu-bashing groups including several academics with a say in the Aryan question. What followed was procedurally not very kosher, with the academics gate-crashing into the debate with a very partisan stance being accepted by the educational authorities as arbiters to a controversy which they themselves had started. "

    - "Dear all, isnt it time for an alphabetical blacklist to be regularly updated in order not to invite the wrong persons financed by public funds ". 
- Attacks on Rajiv Malhotra, who, despite some defective scholarship, has written books that attempted to spur hindu resistance and awareness towards foreign (academic/ evangelical/ political) subversion.
    - 2015 attempt to spur withdrawal of Rajiv Malhotra's books from the market due to overblown plagiarism charges (a few missing and mistaken attributions). \[[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/culture/much-ado-about-plagiarism-fox-vs-malhotra/)\]
        - "he amply quoted him in so many words, though a few times, for the flow of the narrative, he merely rephrased the theses of this much-quoted author. By that standard, most papers contain plagiarism; but what passes unnoticed elsewhere becomes a scandal when done by a self-identifying Hindu. Yet, numerous Indologists started a holier-than-thou tirade against the “plagiarism”, a comical drama to watch. Malhotra then walked the extra mile writing Nicholson out of his narrative and quoting original sources instead (thereby incidentally showing the amount of plagiarism that Nicholson himself had committed, though no Indologist ever remarked on that). But this inconvenient development was given the silent treatment, and Truschke still presupposes that there ever was a substantive “plagiarism” case against Malhotra, and by extension against the whole “Hindu Right”. ... By contrast, Malhotra, by personalizing his argument into specific dissections of the work of leading scholars such as Wendy Doniger, Sheldon Pollock or Anantanand Rambachan, has earned a session at the annual conference of the trend-setting American Academy of Religion. On Indological discussion forums, his input is frequently mentioned, though the academics mostly keep up their airs of pooh-poohing that interloper, in a bid to justify their ignoring his actual critique of their own work."  \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]
        - Petition against the books was started by Jesse Knuston, a Sanskrit professor and collaborator with Sheldon Pollock \[[C15](https://www.change.org/p/harper-collins-india-in-view-of-the-widespread-plagiarism-found-in-rajiv-malhotra-s-book-indra-s-net-published-by-harper-collins-india-we-call-on-the-publisher-to-make-a-formal-public-apology-and-to-withdraw-the-book-from-the-market?recruiter=5167386&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=share_facebook_responsive&utm_term=des-lg-no_src-custom_msg&fb_ref=Default), [N](http://www.niticentral.com/2015/07/15/rajiv-malhotra-on-hindu-intellectuals-niti-exclusive-323900.html)\], with inputs from Richard Fox Young, (Christian seminary professor and collaborator with John Dayal) and  Ananya Vajpeyi. The movement drew support from with ad-hominem attacks by Robert Goldman as well ([BVP](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/3WjZziSAEGo), [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/G3uT0Iu.png)).
- Attacks on Koenraad Elst
    - 2012 expulsion of Koenraad Elst from the RISA mailing list [KE12](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2012/04/us-academics-for-and-against-censorship.html)
    - Condoning distribution of leaflets against him. (Prof. Michael Witzel (7-2-2003) and Prof. Robert Zydenbos (10-2-2003) on the secretive Scholarly Services list - [KE12](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2012/04/us-academics-for-and-against-censorship.html))
    - In other threads (references to be added), Koenraad Elst has described the professional cost of his pro-hindu stance.
        - "In the 90s I have worked a lot on Islamic history, I had studied Persian and made good use of it.. And incidentally, two of my MA diplomas include courses on historical method. ... But I admit, he is far better at lobbying and belongs to a circuit that has very successfully blocked my access to the academy. When you have lost the battle on contents, at least you may win on the institutional front... Most of them (my papers) are (published in academic journals). But the question is typical for people who are status-conscious raher than knowledge-conscious. As you should know by now, the secularist camp has done all in its power to deny me academic employment or avenues of publication." - In response to a certain Conrad Barwa who resorted to name-calling, and questioning his scholarly credentials.
        - "A recent example. In 2014, I read a paper on the Rg-Vedic seer Vasishtha and his relative divinization in a panel on “divinization” at the European Conference for South Asia Studies in Zürich. My paper was enthusiastically received, also by the panel’s organizers when I sent in the final version for publication. First, they accepted it, but then, I received an embarrassed e-mail from the organizers stating that they could not include my paper, without any reason given. Upon my enquiring, the half-line reply said that it did not fit their project. In all its insignificance, this still managed to be a blatant lie, and their earlier acceptance confirmed that this could not have been the reason. But some higher up had warned them that I am to be treated as excluded, just like on many other occasions." \[[PR](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]
- Stopping Subramanian Swamy 
    - Stopping Harvard courses in 2011 ([BBC11](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-16081751)), where a comparative religions professor Diana Eck was prominently involved.
- Dharma Civilization Fund's attempt in 2015 to fund UCI chairs to study Hindusim manned by "scholar practitioners" was thwarted. \[DCF response [1](https://www.z2systems.com/np/clients/dcfusa/viewOnlineEmail.jsp?emailId=1ccedcbd49a97b2226af279e3c2926b41m7787011cc), [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/12/21/irvine-questions-about-professorships-funded-foundation-seeks-change-scholarly-study), \]

### Funding the journals and institutes

- Reg. ISKCON - "Iscon- International Journal of Hindu Studies is basically run by them- Journal of Vaisnava Studies is actively run by them- Oxford Journal of Hindu Studies and Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies gets all their money from them."  \[[AC16](https://www.academia.edu/11637543/Asymmetrical_Religious_Commitments_Religious_Practice_Identity_and_Self-Presentation_among_Western_Scholars_of_Hinduism_and_Buddhism)\]
    - that leaves Journal of Indian Philosophy, History and Culture of South Asia (Oxford), and things like Indo-Iranian journal.
- "Western Academics who work on Indian Religion, literature, culture, philosophy etc generally get what little knowledge they have of Indian society and politics from politics and sociology departments bankrolled by Pakistan and the Middle east that talk about India in terms of poverty, oppression, and sectarian violence- unlike category a here, who when they get a grant for a year get 30,000-40,000 to go do fieldwork in india, people in poli sci or economics or sociology at the top of their field get 100,000+ grants to go do their work and then get published in journals bankrolled by the house of saud etc- their articles (in addition to being read by academics trying to learn something about "modern india") end up incorporated into briefings for state dept officials and so forth".

##   
White-man's burden to "save" Indian/ hindu studies.

### The charge of neglect

- Plenty of Indians agree that the claim that "Value of knowledge by Indians is zero or close to zero." is false. The life of every practicing hindu still places high value on knowledge of traditional hindu knowledge (including performance arts, ritual, music, stories, philosophies).
    - Sanskrit revitalization is an example of a major grassroots movement in this direction.
    - There are plenty of people who attain privately mastery of shAstra and kAvya solely due to their love of those topics and a strong desire to put what they see into practice, not to show how smart they are. These are nourished within private circles centered around local masters in the topic (R Ganesh and his fellow avadhAnin-s jump to mind as an example). This is how it ought to be, and it is healthy. A far cry from the academic knowledge industry. A supposed scholar of kAvya who cannot and has not composed a kAvya is a fraud. Not worth a cent, let alone millions of dollars.
- It is a continuation of "white man's burden" that many Indologits wants to provide the opposite impression (that Indians commonly think that the value of such knowledge is close to zero).
    - Examples: Sheldon discusses in [SP12:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&t=12m00s) Obviously false, and  Of course, the value as he describes in [40:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&t=40m00s) and [55:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&t=55m00s) are quite innately accepted by hindus as well.
- What these aliens consider "vitally important" (often for the purpose of their livelihood, though hypocritically masked in terms of grander purposes) is not necessarily that important to hindus.
- If Indian government and education system does not value such knowledge, it is precisely because of the value system that Sheldon represents - where "secularism" (a post-christian christian virtue which is meaningless and even poisonous for pagans) and "study without practice" (the dry end of the dry-scholar/ practitioner/practitioner-scholar spectrum)  reign supreme.
- While Indian education system has its problems, there are quite a few Sanskrit universities and institutions, where traditional knowledge systems are still studied.
