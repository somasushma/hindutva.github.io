### Varied views

- The classical hindu view is that the world is permeated with consciousness.
- The **deities as entities of wonder:** kRShNa says in the exceptionally brilliant chapter 10 bhagavad-gItA, after identifying himself with a long series of awesome things (such as "दण्डो दमयतामस्मि नीतिरस्मि जिगीषताम्") : "यद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा । तत्तदेवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसम्भवम् ॥ ४१ ॥" - "All that is endowed with glory, grace, grandeur, has sprung from a mere flare of my radiance" (Dr. G L Krishna [here](http://www.sandeepweb.com/the-bhagavad-gita-before-the-battle/)). This is concordant with the hindu notion of divinity.
    - "Āścaryavat paśyati kaścid enam, āścaryavad vadati tathaiva cānyaḥ | Āścaryavac cainam anyaḥ śṛṇoti, śrutvāpy enaṃ veda na caiva kaścit ||" (BG)
    - To paraphrase GL kRShNa: The adoration of awesomeness includes adoration of glorious characters in our legends, the celebration of natural geography (the great rivers, the great mountains, etc. as centres of pilgrimage) and the adoration of sages (from Vyasa-Vishwamitra to Ramana-Ramakrishna).
- Beyond this, the [vaidika view](https://youtu.be/DUsZ_5A7-Ho?list=PLhPjckGlZ7rQFXvhumWnIctUgARdPYayL&t=228) \[[YT](https://youtu.be/DUsZ_5A7-Ho?list=PLhPjckGlZ7rQFXvhumWnIctUgARdPYayL&t=228)\] was that the devatA-s are conscious and willful entities attached to every single living or non-living substance. In one point of view, the dEvatAs are actually concepts which exist in our collective imaginations (say - in the form of [mantra](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/sanskarah/2-2-mantra-and-yantra)-s) and in the natural objects/ forces/ motivations they personify.
- Sallustus's view [p1](https://hermetic.com/texts/on_the_gods-1), [p2](https://hermetic.com/texts/on_the_gods-2).

## Benefits:

- The poetic imaginative way of thinking is involved in abstracting and shaping thought in terms of devatA-s, mantra-s, nyAsa-s, yajJNa-s and stories.
- deva-s are very powerful forces in their capacity to help us intellectually and emotionally distinguish the noble from the ignoble (the emotional cultivation being the dominant contribution). It helps us develop positive qualities and good aspirations in a very deliberate, yet very enjoyable way. As an example, consider the following mundane example: "For a straight back, imagine your head hangs from a thread (ballerinas do)."

na vā are devānāṃ kāmāya devāḥ priyā bhavanti  
ātmanastu kāmāya devāḥ priyā bhavanti |  
na vā are vedānāṃ kāmāya vedāḥ priyā bhavanti  
ātmanastu kāmāya vedāḥ priyā bhavanti |  
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.6)  
Devās are loved, not for their sake,  
but for the sake of the Self  
Vedas are loved, not for their sake,  
but for the sake of the Self  

- Among other things, this reverence of awesome nature and upholders of dharma engenders reverence for nature, and renews of faith in the grandest ideals of this dharma.
- It may even improve our performance at various tasks.
    - Example: The ancestor effect: Thinking about our genetic origin enhances intellectual performance (article [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.778/abstract))
- Not answering prayer stuff (considered in a separate subsection).
    - Personal note: - To me, the influence of the deva-s is limited to being the influence of concepts, symbols and perception on minds (and ultimately behavior) - yet what satisfying influence that can be!

### Aesthetic distance: Not too far removed

- This does not need continued belief in peripheral things like reincarnation, flying yogi-s, texts composing themselves, deities proffering boons and the like; at the same time, the hindu need not let questions like "How can monkeys talk?" hinder his enjoyment of the rAmAyaNa epics or his observance of [rAmanavamI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama_Navami) rituals. This is exactly the same as the concept of "[aesthetic distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic_distance)". Consider an actor in a play: he does not think "this is not real, I am not this character, this is a made up story" etc.. when acting. Neither does the full-hearted audience (sahRdaya rasika) insulate himself from feeling empathy with the characters on stage or in a book with similar questions.
- I emphasize that to a practicing hindu, they are not remotely abstract entities like Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Juno are to (sadly) Christianized Italians; rather they are alive and immediate in the artistic experience that is the hindu way of thought. One propitiates them regularly with various rituals (In fact, I am more observant than most) as if they were wilful entities, and questions about their imaginary nature never enter my mind when involved with hindu rituals. It is a primeval way of looking at nature and life. IshAna still lives in our rage, Indra in our stength, prithivI/ Earth in our body, herbs in our hair, sarasvatI on the tip of my tongue, agni in my speech and so on. (A lament on the fools that chose to leave this for the monotony and paleness of Abrahamisms [is here](http://vishvasvasuki.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/the-fools-that-converted/).)

### Answering prayers, or not.

- An illustrative example: From bhAgavata-purANa 10.24, the central message of kRShNa is "Indra does not cause rains; it is karma and natural processes. You ought to adore karma instead."
    - He then asks the cowherds to adore the hillock and cattle. This, considering the preceding message, is but symbolic and about as meaningful emotionally (to the cowherds) as appeasing the clouds.
    - So, at best, the govardhana incident can be considered an argument against deities that answer to material requests of humans; while endorsing the continuation of pUja as an emotional and symbolic act.
- Rather, the value of deva-s is that they help us express and process our feelings, as explained elsewhere.

### Comparable attitudes

- Socrates on the use of myth [here](https://storify.com/EPButler/on-plato-phaedrus-229b-230a): "I accept what is customarily believed concerning them, and, as I was saying, I look not into them but into my own self: Am I a beast more complicated and savage than Typhon, or am I a tamer, simpler animal with a share in a divine and gentle nature?".
- Sallustus's view [p1](https://hermetic.com/texts/on_the_gods-1), [p2](https://hermetic.com/texts/on_the_gods-2).
- In [this conversation](http://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/german-christian-in-dialogue-with-balinese-on-ramayanas-historicity/) between a bAlinese hindu and a German christian about the historicity of rAMa, the pestered hindu asks: “Do you want to know whether the story is true, or merely whether it occurred?” \[Orientalism and Religion: Post-Colonial Theory, India and “The Mystic East” By Richard King, pp. 39-40\].  
    
- The high priest of Ásatrúarfélagið, the norse temple : “I don’t believe anyone believes in a one-eyed man who is riding about on a horse with eight feet,” Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, told Reuters. “We see the stories as poetic metaphors and a manifestation of the forces of nature and human psychology.” ... The priest said the gods are viewed as mystical and symbolic. Most modern worshipers don’t consider them to be living beings that are capable of flying down from the clouds. ... The Asatru religion might describe itself as poetic--but if some Christians, especially those in the Western hemisphere, were to take a literal look at the new altar to pagan gods they might consider it satanic. ([DailyBeast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/05/why-iceland-is-building-a-temple-to-its-pagan-gods.html))
- "The deities of heaven and earth that appear in the ancient texts and also the spirits enshrined in the shrines; furthermore, among all kinds of beings – including not only human beings but also such objects as birds, beasts, trees, grass, seas, mountains, and so forth – any being whatsoever which possesses some eminent quality out of the ordinary, and is awe-inspiring, is called kami. (Eminence here does not refer simply to superiority in nobility, goodness, or meritoriousness. Evil or queer things, if they are extraordinarily awe-inspiring, are also called kami.) (Norinaga, quoted in Matsumoto 1970:84)" \[FB, Wonderment and awe: way of kami [here](http://refractory.unimelb.edu.au/2004/02/03/wonderment-and-awe-the-way-of-the-kami-lucy-wright/)\]
- Deified heroes among the Chinese \[[WP](https://kashcidvipashcit.wordpress.com/2016/03/26/guan-yu-pagan-reverence-of-anything-awesome/?fb_action_ids=10153616560317989&fb_action_types=news.publishes&fb_source=og_snowlift_photo_robotext)\]

### Eligibility for pUjA

### Examples

- Trinidad and Tobago
    - "Yet it was in 1995, during the celebration of Trinidad and Tobago’s 150th Anniversary of Indian Arrival Day that interested persons in India collected water and dust from two thousand sacred pilgrimage places along the Ganges and this was then brought to Trinidad in two urns specially made of several metals. The dust of nine sacred locations in Trinidad was also added and then, using a machine, a hole was pierced deep into a large slab of stone where the ancient design was interred. Then all was buried at a place (called the prayaag) where two rivers converged to form one, thereby consecrating the river. Thus was teerath created here, making the river officially and spiritually Ganga for local Hindus to come and worship at." [Triniview](http://www.triniview.com/blog/?p=575).
- Mauritius
    - Mauritius gangA and mauritiuseshvara.
- Japan and many buddhist countries

## Hierarchy and Competition

### Hierarchy of deities and spiritual practice

- Various hindu views exist about hierarchies of power among deities.
    - Some place viShNu at the top, others shiva, others indra, others vAyu and so on.
- "First among equals" vs "supreme deity".
    - In the distant Indo Aryan vedic past, there were several polytheistic systems (oft centered around a "the first among equals" among the deva-s), prominent of which included systems centered around :
        - dyaus/ zeus/ jupiter - the archetypical sky god, conflated with indra in some non-Indic branches.
            - Illustration from Illiad, where the devatAs themselves take sides in desperate battles on behalf of their human kin! That this happens is telling. Jupiter clearly reigns as the first among equals, rather than as puppet-master. 
        - indra. There was some fan following of particular deities based on personal preferences - but there was no firmly established doctrine to that effect.
        - rudra class deities
            - rudra/ odin
            - vAyu
    - Coronation of indra by prajApati and deva-s in aitereya-brAhmaNa \[[tw16](https://twitter.com/Dauhshanti/status/762961718058160128)\].
    - Origin stories and one puppet-master antaryAmin
        - The "many from one" view became well established. This is explained the [connection web section](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/svamatam/sambandhajalah). Some systems took the original substance to be impersonal, others took it to be personal.
        -  "Many from one" is tolerable - "many forms of one" or "one antaryAmi puppet-master in everything" is where things risk of Ananda addiction begins to set in. But norse like "many from some thing(s)" seems safest.
    - The "supreme deity" concept gained prominent following.
        - Historical development
            - The prAjApatya system developed where prajApati/ brahma was made to be the supreme deity (far beyond what indra was). He was considered to be the generator deity.
                - Evidence seems to indicate that this happened during the (re)compilation of veda-s in the kuru-pAnchAla-videha kingdom.
            - Later still, he was superseded (via various myths) by shiva/ rudra by the early pAshupata-s (whose panchamukha form corresponding to 5 directions was described in an upaniShad). Alternatively, prajApati was replaced by viShNu by the bhAgavata-s.
            - These then gradually returned to mainstream society, constructing popular temples.
                - gauDIya-s - [१८.११६](http://vanisource.org/wiki/CC_Madhya_18.116)
        - One negative of this was the emphasis of mokSha pursuit (as explained elsewhere).
- Consequences of sectarian "supreme deity" following.
    - Subscription to a supreme deity could, at an extreme, imply abandonment and repudiation of other deities and duties at a personal level.
        - Examples:
            - pAshupata-s urge devapitRkarmatyAga after accepting rudra as sole karta.
                - devavat pitṛvac ca // PS_2.10 //
                - ubhayaṃ tu rudre devāḥ pitaraś ca // PS_2.11 //
            - shrIvaiShNava-s
    - But it did not imply shoving the rejection of dharma and other deities down others' throats. See "Polycentrism" below.
    - Thus, conflict is avoided to a great extant among various cults. No cult is placed beyond the domain of a common notion of dharma.
- The hard "good vs evil" dichotomy is absent in the hindu milieu. Rather, there is the "higher" vs "lower" gradation.
    - There is no hard "good vs evil" dualism seen in dichotomoies such as:
        - the semitic God vs Devil.
        - Zoroastrian ahura mAzDa vs anghri mainyu or asura-adorers vs deva-adorers.
            - daeva-s and asura-s came from the same pantheon. But - "Some deities have been sharply bifurcated. For instance: indra. indra as such is a despised "daeva" while verethragna (vRtrAghna/vRtrahan, an epithet of indra) is a revered yazata."
    - Yet, Hindu tradition is quite clear in Astika traditions being "higher" - eg. shatravo anindrA in shruti \[[MT16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/777684561954242572)\].
    - Even many demons are ultimately redeemable (often at the cost of being terminated by a deva)!
    - Aspects of asura-s, rAkShasa-s etc.. are adored, without rejecting the deva-s (who are presumed to be at the top anyway).
        - niRRti is the dikpAla of the South West.
        - Many are the oblations to various bhUta-s. Then there are oblations to pUtana etc.. during the jAtakarma ritual
        - mahiShAsura is adored, having been syncretized with mhasoba ([MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/08/30/kasar-gavlis/), [MT_TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/703648579211149312)).
        - Despite their many bad qualities, rAvaNa (and several rAkShasa-s) had many great qualities - devotion, ability to do great penance, vigor etc.. All this is acknowledged. In fact, rAvaNa too is adored as a minor deity in certain shaiva systems.
    - In modern times, people have used this absence of dichotomy to subvert hindus.
        - JNU fiction about the "asur" tribe and durga: [TI16](https://trueindology.wordpress.com/2016/02/27/jnu-and-the-saga-of-calumny/). However, their clear anti-hindu antecedents make it easy for orthodox hindu-s to avoid confusion \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/703922268376846336)\].
- Various hindu views exist about the way the core nature of the ultimate being is best expressed.
    - Some say that the ultimate being may be considered as being endowed with all kinds of good qualities.
        - Among them, some say that viShNu describes it the best. Others say the form of shiva describes it the best. And so on.
    - Others say that the ultimate being is best characterized as having no definite qualities.
    - Others say that it is characterized as male and female principles.
- The wrong, but unfortunately popular hierarchy of spiritual practice: Adorers of the Absolute > Adorers of personal deities > Adorers of incarnations > Adorers of myriad ancestors, sages and deities > adorers of petty foorces and spirits \[rAdhAkRShNan [T](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/640585969859694592)\].

### Polycentrism

- Polycentrism: "Many worshipers may worship a single God and regard the other Gods in the field as somehow dependent upon or aspects of their chosen deity." \[[EB](https://storify.com/EPButler/polytheisms-as-religions)\] Different people may be centered on different such Gods, with mutual acceptance (of the "my mother is the best mother in the world" kind).
    - Examples:
        - Egyptian Isis cult - [SP17](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/620209859540062208/photo/1)
        - notes by montheist researchers below.
        - "iShTa-devatA" concept among hindu-s
    - Polycentrism can even exist \*within\* a deity due to it residing in multiple shrines - one may find the universe in one's clan deity (an individuation of the more abstract deva residing in a particular shrine) \[[KV](https://kashcidvipashcit.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/polycentrism-the-clan-deity-case/)\] .
        - "It's really a very important observation, because it shows that polycentricity is a primary feature of polytheism, from the ground up, so to speak, and not the result of the development of some kind of sophisticated, elite theology. Hence the paradigm case of polycentricity is the universal adequacy of a localized deity, not the universality of a nationwide cult." \[[EB](https://twitter.com/EPButler/status/942142795699105792)\]
- Polycentric social field: Mutual acknowledgement of certain multiple Gods (whatever the center) and intimate entanglement between their lores and cults defines a polycentric social field.
    - Examples:
        - Acknowledgement of multiple deities who can each be treated as the center is clear in the vedic lore. \[[MT](http://indiafacts.org/polycentrism-many-one-problem-roots-yoga/#.VF0zlBFGjUZ)\]
        - "Of a dramatist-philosopher-logician from 10th century, jayanta bhaTTa whose work serves as a prototype for the religion/counter-religion distinction and also alludes to the 'tacit recognition' we speak of..."
        - "nAvalar, a devout and orthodox shaiva teacher from shrI lanka who had to contend with western missionaries attacking shaivam. In a certain polemical treatise, he raises a question often asked by the Padres  "Why do you attack only us when there are others within your own religion who believe in gods other than shiva (viSNu, etc) as supreme?" nAvalar proceeds to answer along the lines that these deities are recognized by his own deity & therefore worshiping them is no fault while the "god" of the padres is not recognized; again, alluding to the 'tacit recognition' idea."
    - Squaring with conflicting claims to supremeness.
        - If subrahmaNya is subordinate to shiva or indra or if durgA is created by other deities, it is because he/ she consents to it. So, this willing subordination in a particular context does not necessarily imply lower power - just condescension.
        - Further, the basic essence of other Gods is present in every God - there is just a difference in emphasis.
        - Ideas such as moha-shAstra etc..
- Distinction from monotheism:
    - "These are not "pocket monotheisms" because they tacitly or explicitly presuppose that other Gods, who exist for them in a dependent status, can be and are experienced by others as at the center." \[[EB](https://storify.com/EPButler/polytheisms-as-religions)\]
    - " the degree of intimate entanglement that we see between diverse sects in a common polytheistic field, even where they display strong "single-pointedness", goes far beyond that of a congery of "wannabe monotheisms"." \[[EB](https://storify.com/EPButler/polytheisms-as-religions)\]
- Acknowledgement by monotheist researchers:
    - "In the Veda, however, the gods worshipped as supreme by each sect stand still side by side. No one is first always, no one is last always. Even gods of a decidedly inferior and limited character assume occasionally in the eyes of a devoted poet a supreme place above all other gods. It was necessary, therefore, for the purpose of accurate reasoning to have a name, different from polytheism, to signify this worship of single gods, each occupying for a time a supreme position, and I proposed for it the name of Kaihenotheism, that is a worship of one god after another, or of Henotheism, the worship of single gods." \[[MM](https://books.google.com/books?id=DLQIAAAAQAAJ&dq=kulluka%20bhatta%20garga&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q=henotheism&f=false)\]
    - "Grimm showed that Thorr is sometimes the supreme god, while at other times he is the son of Odinn. This, as Professor Zimmer truly remarks, need not be regarded as the result of a revolution, or even of gradual decay, as in the case of Dyaus and Tyr, but simply as inherent in the character of a nascent polytheism. ... ' Among not yet civilised races prayers are addressed to a god with a special object, and to that god who is supposed to be most powerful in a special domain. He becomes for the moment the highest god to whom all others must give place. He may be invoked as the highest and the only god, without any slight being intended for the other gods.' " \[[MM](https://books.google.com/books?id=DLQIAAAAQAAJ&dq=kulluka%20bhatta%20garga&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q=henotheism&f=false)\]
- Risk in terms of understanding and classification
    - "A key reason that polytheisms will never be regarded by some as "proper" religions is because the full potential of a polytheistic field need not be present for any given individual worshiper (who may have a specific supreme deity as his focus)." \[[EB](https://storify.com/EPButler/polytheisms-as-religions)\]
    - "The monotheists and closeted monotheists will then argue that there is no such recognition (of polycentrism) and what one calls polytheism is simply an assemblage of "wannabe monotheisms"."  \[[EB](https://storify.com/EPButler/polytheisms-as-religions)\]
    - "this is the erasure of polytheisms as religions, that they are conceived as mere material assemblages that necessarily disintegrate under analysis. This means that only credal faiths can count as "religions"." \[[EB](https://storify.com/EPButler/polytheisms-as-religions)\]
- Importance of the polycentric discourse:
    - "Where the polycentric polytheistic field is explicitly articulated as such, we have the perfection of a philosophical discourse about religion, but this perfection is not a condition for the existence of polytheism as such, or for its essential polycentricity." \[[EB](https://storify.com/EPButler/polytheisms-as-religions)\]
    - "It is just that our thinkers & leaders are yet to fully grapple with this depth of discourse. Many of them would not be able to formulate a decent explanation of why this tacit recognition is more pronounced than one would give credit for & is indeed adequate." \[[EB](https://storify.com/EPButler/polytheisms-as-religions)\]

### Competition between cults of deities

[![Rigveda deities](http://i.imgur.com/MiHbDlw.jpg)](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/737037012390285312/photo/1) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C0ug3E8WIAE77EH.jpg)](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/813921173390106624/photo/1)

  

- The great sage Charles Darwin proposed the principle of natural selection. A generalization of his vision informs this narrative.
- Every cult (or memeplex) that is more successful (ie fitter) than others (or successful at the cost of others) in the ecosystem of Indian minds, became so because of its superior adaptations. This spans not only hindu cults, but also buddhist ones - they were all in the meme pool competing against each other. You who use the term "comparative evolution" should consider these obvious parallels to biological evolution.
    - The govardhana incident is a transparent (and in hindsight successful) attempt by the kRShNa cult to supplant the ancient vaidika aindra cult. This we also see in the khANDava forest conflict, and it is in line with other paurANika cult competitions (eps. shiva vs viShNu, as in: narasimha -> sharabha -> gaNDaberuNDa chain).
    - buddhist subversion of hindu deities \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/05/25/the-anti-shaiva-rants-of-the-nastika-s/), [MT2](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/lama-taranatha%E2%80%99s-account-of-the-nastika-virupa-the-younger/), [TW1](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/736035929631100928)\].

- Indian deity competitions show various successful adaptations, such as:
    - absorption (eg. Indra is but a small manifestation of kRShNa, is less powerful)
    - establishment of superior power (rAma defeats paraShurAma, sharabha humbles narasimha but is humbled by gaNDaberuNDa etc..)
        - This extends to magic contests (atleast in popular imagination) - a gaNDaberuNDa-nRsimha mantra may supersede a sharabha deployment by an enemy.
        - A few pre-Aryan (and superficially anti-Arya) deities - [HH13](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/rivalry-between-tribal-entities-and-the-mainstream/).
    - dismissal of rival narratives as ploys to confuse ignoble asura-s or cursed fakers. Eg.
        - varAha-purANa calling rudra "moha" and generating moha-shAstra-s, and trying to rescue the confused with nihshvAsa-samhitA [WP17](https://kashcidvipashcit.wordpress.com/2017/11/03/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%88%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%81-%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D/).
        - jayadratha the kAshmIra describing bauddha anti-astika tropes as confusion emerging out of a ploy by bRhaspati. \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/777715943317377024)\]
        - In "lay" circles the shivapurANa posits that viShNu incarnated as tathAgata or arihant to produce fake shAstra-s. \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/777715943317377024)\]
        - Claims to greater authority through association with honored beings, known from ancient times \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/777715943317377024)\]. Also see notes on argument from authority and ploys to dismiss those [here](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/0-1-pramanani-bases/0-15-holy-books-limits).

        - Later found in Tibetan vajrayAna as dorje shugden.
- Dealing with foreign deities.
    - Translate and relocate
        - Deities are easily translatable and relocatable to other geo-spatial contexts - by special rituals, or crafting new sthala-purANa-s (place-stories). Greeks and Romans the other people’s Theoi or Dei were Theoi and Dei.
        - Plutarch and near contemporaries - [TW17](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/620209859540062208).
    - Identify as lesser or inimical
        - Foreign deities were sometimes described as being lesser (xudra-devatA-s/ monstrous), somewhere lower in the heirarchy of one's own favorite deities; or as entirely opposite forces. \[Virgil's Rome-egypt-monstorous-gods quote[here](https://twitter.com/EPButler/status/940687467736391682)\] They were considered powerful, requiring appeals to one's own gods to counter or contain them (yajJNa-muSha-s in taittirIya-samhitA 3.5.4.1 - [Sa](https://archive.org/stream/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series/ASS_042_Krishna_Yajurvediya_Taittiriya_Samhita_Part_6_-_Kasinath_Sastri_Agase_1949#page/n21/mode/2up)yaNa, mahAbhArata etc..

    - Adaption and absorption
        - Explained earlier in the hindu case.
        - "we see Egyptians adopting foreign Gods, numerous Canaanite deities and also Nubian Gods, keeping their original, foreign names but labeling them as Netjeru, as "Gods", just like their native Gods."
- Contrast with deity competition in other eco-systems.
    - When the deity cults were closely connected with an enemy nation, one would occasionally find fomenting of intolerance towards those cult's practices. While objections to specific enemy religious practices arose partly from one's own sense of high culture, the dissuasion of regard to deities of enemy nations occurred only in case of conflict, as one could occasionally find the conflicts between nations perceived and described in terms of conflicts between the corresponding nations' deities. Example:
        - "Biblical vilification of child sacrifice to the god Moloch by the Canaanites." \[[KE16](https://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/the-sati-strategy-koenraad-elst/)\]
        - "Roman war leaders would emphasize this phenomenon of child sacrifice among the Carthaginians to portray them as barbarians in urgent need of Rome’s civilizing intervention." \[[KE16](https://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/the-sati-strategy-koenraad-elst/)\]
        - "Caesar would also demonize as human-sacrificers the Druids of Gaul, another “barbarian” country the Romans “liberated” from its own traditions after conquering it." \[[KE16](https://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/the-sati-strategy-koenraad-elst/)\]
        - Likewise, the Chinese Zhou dynasty justified its coup d’état (11th century BCE) against the Shang dynasty by demonizing the Shang as practising human sacrifice. \[[KE16](https://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/the-sati-strategy-koenraad-elst/)\]
        - The cult of Isis was proscribed in Rome as it was at war with Cleopatra's Egypt. \[Insert link\]
        - Maori forcing Maoriri to defile their ancestor's shrines. \[Insert link\]
    - Suppression of cults as part of pagan consolidation (oft in response to abrahamist threats) and voluntary acculturation.
        - Japanese suppression of Ainu culture.
        - Suppression of local Metei cults by the vaishNavized elite \[[IMG1](http://i.imgur.com/gUXx6iW.png)\].
    - One adaptation that was wildly successful was one of Mosaic exclusivism. It incited violent intolerance towards adoration of other deities, and alternative forms of adoration.
        - An early form of this can bee seen in the harsh good vs evil dichotomy one sees in the Zoroastrian ahura mAzDa vs anghri mainyu and the asura-adorers vs deva-adorers case.
        - The harsh reactions to this on the part of more free spirited polytheists, was a successful response. Examples:
            - Roman suppression of Christianity (Too late) - more [here](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/8-other-pagans/1-pre-xtian-europe).
            - Thorough Japanese suppression of Christianity in the 17th century \[more [here](https://sites.google.com/site/hindujapanology/5-rivals/0-christianity)\].
    - The above probably says something about how the Indian ecosystem was different from the middle eastern or other ecosystems -
        - there was the hoary vedic lore one could not afford to diss,
        - the competition happened in the hearts and minds of philosophers well established in their homeland, rather than a population of common ruffians stressed by an exile to Babylon or escape from Egypt.

## Apotheosis and divine incarnation

- In the hindu traditions raising humans to a divine level is very easy and common.
- Recent ancestors and sages are treated as de-facto deva-s with supernatural powers. brAhmaNa-s are described as bhU-sura-s; cows and certain plants are venerated.
- Some bhakta-s are said to be raised to the level of protector deities \[eg nandin, chaNdesha, bhR^i~NgiriTi, kubera - [TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/841857310012112896)\]

## Mono vs polytheism

For related concepts, see the hierarchy section above. Both monotheism and polytheism have their own pros and cons.

- Polytheism
    - More accommodating of other cults
    - Better explanation of vagaries of nature:
        - Illustration from Illiad, where the devatAs themselves take sides in desperate battles on behalf of their human kin! That this happens is telling. Jupiter clearly reigns as the first among equals, rather than as puppet-master.
- Monotheism
    - There is an essential regularity in the universe. There is the question of the ultimate cause.
- Both

### Are hindu-s monotheists (in the abrahamist sense)?

"Nowadays, very many Hindus will tell you that in essence, Hinduism is a monotheism. These Hindus are not even aware of the proper meaning of this word. Monotheism does not mean that you worship one God (already requiring a serious reinterpretation of the many Gods effectively worshipped by most Hindus, from the Vedic rishis on down), the way some Hindus choose one God to worship from among many, a phenomenon that scholars of religion call henotheism. Nor is it the inclusive oneness of a divine essence underlying all the gods, or monism, as enunciated in the profoundest Vedic verses. It means an exclusive worship of a jealous God banishing all others. Mono- does not mean “one”, as Hindus seem to think; it means “alone”, hence “not tolerating another”. It does not say: “Allah and Shiva are one”, it says: “Only Allah is true, burn Shiva.” So far, there is no such jealous God in Dharma." \[Koenraad Elst [here](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.in/2015/02/down-with-decolonization.html)\].

### vaiShNava monotheism trope

"vaiShNavas are monotheist" is about as useful a characterization as "humans are apes". Point is that they are not "monotheistic" in the same sense as the desert madnesses. Clear significant points of deviation are:

- \* viShNu can appear in avatAra-s a multitude of whom are adored.
- \* viShNu has a consort, a vehicle and innumerable servants and devotees who are also adored in about the same way as viShNu.
- \* Even shiva, shakti, skanda etc.. are considered limited aspects of viShNu, and as such their adoration is not considered evil - merely inferior from one's own perspective. They are not characterized as "false gods" (in the sense of the semitic cancers). This is non-exclusivism.

  

Terminology (such as "monotheism") should illuminate complex subjects and bring clarity - not promote confusion and nonsense false-equivalences. Perhaps people should move beyond "monotheism" and learn more terms such as Jan Assman's "Mosaic distinction".

  

Coming back to the immediate point - these sardaars show traits typical of secularists - on the surface turned their backs on mosaic religion, while retaining the same disdain for heathens and their practices. In other words, the beliefs are different, but patterns in thoughts and practices remain like a poison dart stabbing heathen welfare.

  

Same applies to pAshupata-s and such shaiva-s.

## Other near-human near-god beings

#### Among hindu-s

- Superhuman sky-travellers
    - siddha-s, chAraNa-s, vidyAdhara-s
    - gandharva-s
    - yakSha-s
    - asura-s (including daitya-s like hiraNyakashipu and bali, dAnava-s like maya) and rAxasa-s (like rAvaNa)
        - "asura is used as an apithet of varuNa, rudra and, wait, indra himself in the Rgveda"
        -  one of the classic (but obscure to modern hindu) synonyms for asura-s is "पूर्वदेव" (= former deva-s, now fallen into a corrupt station)
        - Some of them continue to be objects of adoration (see note on "good vs evil dichotomy" above.)
        - Distinction:
            - In several works, the distinction between asura-s and rAxasa-s is clear.
                - rAmAyaNa [TW17](https://twitter.com/kashcit/status/940778023480999938), [IMG](https://imgur.com/BTgmS4S).
                - amarakosha
                    - असुरा दैत्यदैतेयदनुजेन्द्रारिदानवाः। शुक्रशिष्या दितिसुताः पूर्वदेवाः सुरद्विषः॥
                    - राक्षसः कौणपः क्रव्यात्क्रव्यादोऽस्रप आशरः॥
            - asura and rAxasa-s don't seem functionally different. We have a vRtra juxtaposed with a rAvaNa, a prahlAda juxtaposed with vibhIShaNa. Some asura-s and some rAxasa-s are venerated.
- vAnara-s and the like
    - Possible inspiration from other coexisting homo-species
        - Neanderthals and trolls and giants in Europe - [NA16](https://cogniarchae.wordpress.com/2016/12/01/neanderthals-in-ancient-mythology/).

#### Among non-hindu-s

- Titans
    - Mostly imprisoned in Tartarus, but some were revered "Saturn is identified with Kronos, a Titan, and yet has an important cult in Rome. Rhea, when she is identified with Kybele, also has important cultus in the Hellenistic era."
- Giants and Trolls
- Fairies
- Elves
- Dwarves

## Other topics

### The creator, cause of creation, nature of creator

Was there a creation? Then, there is the question of the creator - was it intelligent? Unlike abrahamisms which consider it as an unquestionable axiom, the Hindu vaidika tradition considers it requiring support from argument and speculation. I agree and mostly leave it at that.

Whence creation? Whence suffering (negative experiences) in the world? Some classic answers:

-  'तत्सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्' (तै. उ. २ । ६ । १) 
- kuto jagatsRShTiH? iti prashnasyAtrottaram nihitam syaat - vIrashRngArAder anubhUtir anyathA katham syAt? kva cha vIryam bhItim vinA, kva rAmo rAvaNam vinA (kuto .asRjal loke duHkham ity AxepasyApy atraiva labhe samAdhAnam).
- "Emotions are not positive or negative, they are only strong or mild. Like vibrations. We may pay for some and some may kill us." - shrI sthAneshvara

Is the creator not compassionate to suffering? Classic answers:

- For those who want to exit the game and reunite with him, he offers a way out.
- For those who want material needs satisfied - there is the law of karma, subject to which he helps or not.

Varied views:

- The Samkhyakarika accepts the notion of higher selves or perfected beings but rejects the notion of God. \[[sk](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&pg=PA258#v=onepage&q&f=false)\]

### (A)theism/ (a)dEvism?

The English word God may to a hindu mean either a deity ([dEvatA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_%28Hinduism%29)) or that which pervades everything ([brahman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman)) (both of which are distinct from the Abrahamist notion of a true God). This leads to confusion while talking to Hindus. Hindu-s have a stronger need (because of unique conditioning) for distinguishing deva from brahman compared to say Egyptians or Japanese. So, their tendency to take God to mean brahman is quite understandable.

This results in hindu-s confusingly (and to a certain extant, confusedly) identifying themselves as "monotheists" rather than polytheists, and calling their gods "demigods". This is misuse of an language (which is inadequate in the first place), given what these terms mean to others - like having to do arithmetic using the roman numerals rather than the hindu place-value numeric notation.

The latter is mostly uncontrovertial, so I deal with the fomer.  

Personal note: For all purposes practical to most atheists, I am an atheist (in that I don't believe in a god who orchestrates supernatural phenomena to answer prayers); yet in nearly all ways which matter to most theists, I am a theist.
