## Allowence for tradition-specific exclusive ritual spaces and beliefs

- "As it is in a diverse, polytheist society, every group of Hindus, has a general right to create its own traditions and develop an exclusive ritual space for its own needs. The rural traditions centred around their local, village pantheons as well as the tribal systems had their own separate, sacred spaces. Even then, brāhmaṇa-s, who overwhelmingly were responsible for developing the śrauta, gṛhya, paurāṇika and āgamika ritual content, were interested in expanding access for their non- brāhmaṇa brethren." \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
- Eg. shaiva dIxita-s of chidambaram/ tillai and Adishaiva-s ([TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/890124547244122112)), a temple exclusively officiated by married dalit women \[[NDTV18](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-odisha-a-temple-where-only-dalit-women-are-allowed-breaks-rules-first-time-in-400-years-1841251)\].
