## Mantra-s

### What is the power of mantra-s?

It is an aid to concentrating the mind on the deity or a sentiment. This is often true in the context of a ritual.

Many attribute supernatural effects beyond it - mAraNa, vashIkaraNa, uchChATana, stambhana, mohana, vidveShaNa ... All these are said to be possible with mastery (siddhi) over a single mantra and knowledge of appropriate rituals.

- siddhI is said to be earned by practice involving diet and behavior restriction, japa, Asana-s, prANAyAma-s, secrecy (AG\_T\_27.3 [IMG](https://imgur.com/ZY9clni)) etc.. over an indeterminate period of time - under the guidance of a (dear) personal trainer/ guru (who helps avoid or counteract bad side-effects). Potential bad effects (physical, mental etc..) and errors in books (deliberate or otherwise) dissuade unguided uninitiated practice of many mantra-s.
- Greater the siddhi, tougher the things that are said to be possible. Master tAntrikas sometimes train from childhood, with a big syllabus of mantra-s and rituals - and have siddhi-s over multiple mantra-s. The deshika-s among them are said to even be capable of making new effective mantra-s for disciples.

### Whence the power of mantra-s?

#### Embodiment and reverance

parAkhya tantra [TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/867148873692835840). mantreshvaras/ vidyeshvaras as embodied aspects of brahman [TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/899223199996461056), associated with particular mantra-s. The vidyesha-s are denied union with brahman just so that they can uplift us, and are therefore quite disgusted by the world (and irritable). Knowledge of this embodiment makes reverence and formality surrounding a mantra common-sense.

#### Avesha

Excerpts from an insightful comment from another thread by shrI[ manISha-paNDita](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10152896239417989?notif_t=like): 

`"The mantra first creates an image of the deity which is inherently present within the mantra. ``That image when strong enough to take a life of its own "shields the mind". ``The image starts finally getting replaced for moments at a time with the actual Devatha. ..... <snip> ``The more the sadhaka who has managed to attract a certain Devata on occasion... repeats that mantra... the more the Devata starts to descend into the consciousness of the sadhaka. The sadhaka changes and his or her mind and personality slowly start getting replaced with the personality of the Devata in question." ``{End quote}`

Also see notes on Avesha as an end in \[[IF16](http://indiafacts.org/brief-study-possession-hinduism-ii-spiritual-context/)\].

Meaning:

- To understand what a mantra says and, to feel what the mantra feels: This is one good reason why learning Sanskrit, with its stresses (svara-s) is valuable.
- General background on multi-level ways to derive meaning out of texts in general is presented [here](../bases/books.md).
- Some claim that it is not necessary to understand what the words in the mantra mean (to whatever extant the grammar would allow). A kautsa opinion, quoted and refuted by yAska, denies that it has any grammatical meaning (while not denying the value of the mantra in ritual ). Such opinion is condemned in quotes in shikSha texts which denounce pATha without "understanding" with the aid of vedAnga-s (शीघ्रपाठी…). (Personal note: I strongly disagree. While a mantra can contain meanings beyond what is revealed by mere grammar and vocabulary, that lower level of meaning is important in itself, and as an aid to access deeper meanings.)

Some claim that mantra-s are ineffective in case:

- The user is not specially initiated \[Personal note: partially disagree\]
- In case some 'curse' on a mantra is not removed ([BVP16](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/Tz9zsuJGSN4)) \[Personal note: disagree\]

- Jewish view of mantra-s : [T14](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/164141/forbidden-jewish-magic-books).

### Matching mantra-s with rituals

- nyAsa places mantra-s and deities at various parts of an object or body. Classic examples date back to the veda-s. \[[IF16](http://indiafacts.org/brief-study-possession-hinduism-ii-spiritual-context/)\]
- A general (bad) rule is "मन्त्रविनियोगो लैङ्गिकः।" , where one bases the choice of the mantra for a certain purpose based on the occurance of a similar sounding sound or word in it, not caring for the meaning (Eg. The so called durgA sUkta is mostly about agni. The "Vijyam dhanuh kapardino" has nothing to do with "vijayA" or bhAng intake where it's sometimes used.).

## mudra-s

These are the sign-analogs of mantra-s. So, similar notes apply.

  

Abhinavagupta and Kshemaraja considered mudrā as a “way of accessing higher layers of the cosmos, meaning individual consciousness is absorbed into or possessed (āvesa) by mudrā…one’s own body becomes possessed by the mudrā and mantra, which can be read as becoming a channel for higher cosmic powers, which erode the sense of individuality and distinction.” \[Gavin Flood, 1993.\]. Abhinavagupta, further, says that all actions of an awakened one are in fact mudrā!

## yantra-s
