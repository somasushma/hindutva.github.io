    -  only brAhmaNas are completely prohibited from alcohol shUdras have no prohibitions at all & that kSatriyas are allowed to drink the alcohol named madhu (fruit wine) and are only prohibited from surA (liquor from rice and other grains such as barley)
- Ancient recommendations:
    - "For example, we learn that food was eaten while being seated (Rigveda Saṃhitā 4.30.3), food was eaten only twice a day (Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1.4.9), and that talking was kept to a minimum while eating (Baudhayana Dharmasūtra 2.7.2). In times of emergencies, there were absolutely no restrictions on food (Brahma Sūtra 3.4.29-31). We are asked to greet our food, honour it, rejoice upon seeing it, and pray that we may always obtain it (Manusmṛti 2.54-55)." [SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).
    - Veg promotion
        - "मुन्यन्नं ब्राह्मणस्योक्तं मांसं क्षत्रियवैश्ययोः " इत्यादि वाक्यं तु याज्ञवल्क्यस्मृतेः (१.२६१) मिताक्षरायां पुलस्त्यस्मृतेरुद्धृतम्।
    - Meat restriction
        - अपञ्चनखेषु
            - अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यकुक्कुटः अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यसूकरः। (महाभाष्ये)
        - पञ्चनखेषु
            - पञ्च पञ्च नखा भक्ष्या ब्रह्मक्षत्रेण राघव 4.17.38।। शल्यक श्श्वाविधो गोधा शशः कूर्मश्च पञ्चमः। (नान्ये)
- Factors towards vegetarianism. 
    - Historical reasons. Why do many types of hindu-s not eat meat? Because their parents and relatives did not eat meat, and they have no idea why, and it is now a matter of cultural identity. Ok, why did this practice start and why was it sustained?
        - Primary reasons:
            - the theory that food influences feelings and behavior, in a way not appropriate for these peoples' traditional vocations. Meat is \_supposedly\_ rAjasika-tAmasika-guNa-pradhAna, and rare are the agnihotR-s who can cope with it in this age.
            - The karma theory: a person who eats meat will—in his next birth—become the meat eaten by that animal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.6.1.3).
        - Secondarily, the veda-s and other holy texts urge non-violence as described [here](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/3-civilizational-appraisal/3-0-paraih-sambandhah/violence-hinsa) (barring exceptions).
    - Additional reasons
        - Sustainability
- Personal note: I am ovo-lacto-vegetarian\- I eat mushrooms, fungi and commercially available egg (that single unfertilized haploid cell which cannot possibly grow into an animal). A dietary update while still retaining that beloved plant-subsistence typical of my people. I continue to abstain from alcohol and tobacco.
