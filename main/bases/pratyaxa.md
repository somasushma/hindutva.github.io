- Direct observation (extensible to experimental science) is a valuable source of knowledge in some cases (mokSha according to some), but not in others (dharma).
- It may augment the overall validity of texts in some cases (see "holy books") or refute literal or non-contextual understanding of specific portions. Examples for the latter:
    - Ancient mathematical approximations for planetary positions prove inadequate when we directly observe these positions.
- The pratyaxa of one person is always of questionable utility to another - Depends on the reliability and relatability of the experiencer vis-a-vis the other.
