title: Heroes महानुभावाः
---
  

  

## Preface:

Here I list some great personalities I personally admire. Note: Hindu sounds are encoded in the latin alphabet using [OPTITRANS](http://sanskritnlp.appspot.com/optitrans.html).

### Definition and critique:  

Every person has some noble and some ignoble qualities. What makes a hero? A hero is a person, who may be flawed, but persistently develops and displays (personally and socially) noble traits, and does great deeds.

Heroes do not function in a vaccum: rather, they are able achieve their deeds building upon the deeds of others, and only due to cooperation and help from others. Of course, one should remember that the traits themselves should be the focus of admiration, and one should not descend to chauvinism which tries to deny unpleasent truths about these people.

### My reasons:  

Why heroes? Stories of heros are often riveting; remembering their stories is an important part of cultivating a self which strives for these qualities when appropriate. Why heroes from bhArata? I am emotionally (and biologically) attached to this 5000+ year old culture and people; so the inspiration I can draw from them is much stronger.  

Why make a list? Maybe this interests others. Helps organize my thoughts on the matter, frees up my overly engrossed mind to pursue other interests.

[![kRRiShNArjuna](http://larryavisbrown.homestead.com/files/arjuna_Krishna_chariot.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnbJxbUMI8s)

  

- manu vaisvata, pitR, the likely progenitor of 100M of us R1a carrying Indo Aryans \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/05/08/the-giants-among-the-lilliputs/)\], first king of the solar dynasties, a the great lawgiver and ritualist, who among other things sagely advised wariness towards shUdra-s and mlecCha-s of his time \[[here](../social-cultivation/clan/india-entry.md)\].
    - वैवस्वतो मनुर् नाम माननीयो मनीषिणाम्। आसीन् महीक्षिताम् आद्यः प्रणवश् छन्दसाम् इव॥ इति कालिदासः। 
- Others listed in ([SV](https://sites.google.com/site/samskrtamsfo/kavyam/itihasah/vansah/bhargavah)) and allied pages. Especially 
    - [parashu-rAma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parashurama), the bhArgava revolutionary; and other bhArgava heroes .

#### panchajana-wave

- divodAsa, father of sudAsa (contemporary of purukutsa) who won the 10 king war, much honored in the veda-s.
    -   काशीराजः । स चन्द्रवंशीयभीमरथराजपुत्त्रः । इति पद्मपुराणम् ॥ 
- trasadasyu, born to Purukutsa by his wife, Purukutsānī, at a time of great distress, energetic king of the purus settled along the sarasvatI,  a famous sacrificer of ancient times.
- kRShNa, leader of the yadu-s, who likely repulsed the sAlva invasion historically \[[SS](http://www.oocities.org/somasushma/dalbhya.html)\], famously naughty and \*\*violent\*\* as a kid \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/27/the-dark-hero-of-the-yadus/)\], great guide, clever manipulator, the symbol of dharma in action at the social level (his role as a personification of the universe's mockery of silly humans' best plans and dharmas is entirely separate).

#### ikShvAku wave

- bhagIratha, whose stupendous determination brought ganga to the earth and pAtAla, liberating his forefathers.
- janaka, knower of brahman, patron of brAhmaNa-s.
- [rAma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama), rAjA of ayodhyA, maryAdA-puruShOttama, keeper of the dharma, the symbol of family-consciousness.
    - On his abandonment of sItA: uttarakANDa is probably a a later insert into the epic. Nevertheless, rAma gets criticized in sanskrit literature (eg: kAlidAsa puts regret in rAma's mouth in raghuvaMsha). Also, a fair analysis [here](http://prekshaa.blogspot.com/2010/03/abandoning-of-sita.html?m=1). 
    - Killing the shUdra sage shambuka for the protection of dharma: A simple jAti-tapas dissociation does not fit well with the character who gladly eats fruit soiled by shabarI, who embraces guha the king of niShAda-s.
        - nArada's statement: "“...a man of the lowest caste may not give himself up to penance in the Dwapara Yuga; it is only in the Kali Yuga that the practice of asceticism is permitted to the Shudra caste."  
            
        - Wiki: "The apologetics[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambuka#cite_note-7) firstly argue that not all tapas is done for a pious purpose. [Ravana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana "Ravana"), a Brahmin killed by Rama, had also performed penance but not for pious reasons. They argue that Shambuka was killed for conducting penance with a motive of attaining a celestial power with his material body, which is not an unselfish motive for which penance is meant to be performed. It is particularly forbidden (e.g. story of [Trishanku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishanku "Trishanku")) in [Hindu mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_mythology "Hindu mythology") to aspire for entering heaven with a material body. The belief is that the material body, i.e. Annamaya [Kosha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha "Kosha"), is mortal and is meant only for performing ones [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma") on earth."
- vibhIShaNa, who defected to do the right thing.
- satya-[harIshachandra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harishchandra), who did not forsake the truth.

#### kuru-s among puru-s

- vidura, the dAsI-putra, wise and honest counselor.
- yuyutsu, son of dhRtarAShTra from gAndhArI's vaishya maid, who aided the pANDava-s and the upholding of dharma in their contest against his own kaurava kin.
- vikarNa, the noble kaurava, who like yuyutsu vocally abhorred kaurava adharma, but stayed loyal to family, as is proper.
- shakunI, clever manipulator - one man felled the entire kuru clan.
- karNa, dAna-vIra-shUra, generous king, loyal friend, great warrior.  
    

#### pANDava wave

- bhIma, so filled with kShatra and power, taunted his enemies, exacted his revenge by plucking out the beating heart of duHshAsana and eating it, before dying draupadii's hair with that blood.
- draupadii pAnchAlI of five husbands, who desired and obtained revenge for her humiliation.
- abhimanyu, the hero who entered and died in a trap.
-   
    

#### yavana (Ionian) invasions:

- pushyamitra-shunga, who put an end to ineffective maurya dynasts and set the stage for a solid imperial renewal. An ancestor of agnimitra of mAlavIkAgnimitra fame.
- vikramAditya, rAjA of ujjayanI, the wise vanquisher of the vEtAla, vanquisher of shakas.
- gautamIputra shAtakarNI shAlivAhana/ [shAtavAhana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satavahana), vanquisher of shakas, yavanas and pahlavas; he who is said to have created soldiers out of mud and breathed prANa into them (ie inspired and organized ordinary people) after the decimation of warriors.
- kaniShka the kuShAna, mahArajAdhiraja (Emperor of India), Kaisara (for the romans), Kshatriya-tama (for the Persians), and deva-putra (for the Chinese), one of the rare Indian powers who defeated the Chinese and kept them at bay, under whom the kaumAra-shAsana rose in hindu thoughtscape; under whom sogdiana was referred to by the chIna-s as uttarApatha; under whom Indic thought flowed over to central asia. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/26/chinese-policy-of-kushanas/)\] 

Non-heroes: ashOka chakravartI dEvanAmapriya, who - contrary to legend - did not give up warfare after the kaLinga carnage, who led to a decline in brAhmaNa patronage.

- bhadravarman, ruler of champa, reigned from 380CE to 413 CE and Sanskrit inscriptions from his reign show that he had learned the recitation of the vedic saMhitA-s and performed vedic rituals. He calls himself a devotee of rudra, and he celebrated the grace of rudra in securing his victory over the chIna-s by building the glorious temple for shiva termed shrI bhadreshvara. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/02/15/the-greatest-temple-of-shiva/)\]

- Santaji Mhaloji Ghorpade, (1660-1696) of the broader bhosale community, named by Shivaji on his death bed to be among six pillars of Maratha Empire, who in a daring feat cut the ropes of Aurangzeb’s tents and took the imperial golden pinnacles and fled boosting marATha morale and confidence, argued oft with rAjArAm over decisions and was sacked.
- hambirrAv mohite, commander in chief of shivAjI and shambhu, father of Tarabai.
    -  In early 1676, Hambirrao led a daring raid into Mughal territory as far as Bharuch in Gujarat & after much heroic fighting, brought back a large booty to the Raigad treasury. Later, during the karNATaka campaign, when shivAji had to rush back to raigarh, hambirrAv defeated Adil shAh armies and Ekoji.
    - During the attack on diler khAn and mogols while aiding Adil shAh - he saved shivAji's trapped army and trounced diler's army.
    - He harassed the mogols under sambAji- "Shahabuddin Khan, father of Nizam-ul-Mulk, advanced with a huge army to take Raigad. Crisis once again! And yet again it was Hambirrao's cavalry which fell upon d besiegers routing them completely! Hambirrao immediately followed that up with another counter attack. 60 miles South East of Pune, Aurangzeb had setup an elephant stable with a large number of elephants. Hambirrao's cavalry swooped down upon it, massacred the Mughal garrison drove off d entire herd of elephants! ... Shivaji had massacred Afzal Khan's army in the forests below Pratapgad. It was Sarja's turn now. Hambirrao drew Sarja Khan's army deeper into the dense jungles around Mahabaleshwar & suddenly fell upon them. ... The Mughals were completely surrounded & massacred. But just at that moment of a decisive victory a most tragic event happened. Hambirrao was hit by a stray gun shot & fell dead.".
        - "Then the Mogol mined two of the hill slopes leading up to Mahabaleshwar plateau where the Maharattas were stationed and filling them with explosives, detonated it. Shaken by these two explosions the Maharattas began to flee helter-skelter. The Mogols soon rolled their heavy artillery and opened heavy fire on Hambirrao’s army. Hambirrao realized that his men would not hold out much longer and a defeat more or less guaranteed the end the Maharatta resistance to the Mogols in Maharashtra. Unless he turned the tide right there there was no hope stopping the Mogols from marching right through. With a chosen group of 100 ace commandos he rushed straight at Sarja Khan with the aim of killing him. This Maharatta band fought with unbelievable fury leaving a lane of blood and severed heads through the Mogol army. The swordsmanship of Mohite was unrivalled as he cut deep into the Mogol troops bringing down all before him and reaching the artillery line. His men fell upon the Mogol heavy artillery and destroyed the operators and wetted the powder. Seeing the tables turning, the fleeing rank and file of the Maharatta army recovered and fell upon the Mogols with renewed fury. The Mogols were completely swept away by the attack destroyed. However, in the midst of this Sarja Khan surrounded Hambirrao. The Mohite’s horse was shot down under him, but he continued fighting on foot and struck Sarja with his sword killing him. He was attacked on all sides and his strength was ebbing from the cuts he received. But leaning against a tree Hambirrao continued fighting keeping the Moslem assilants at bay till head was finally cut off. However, the surge of the Maharatta army was so great that the Mogol army was completely destroyed." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/06/02/the-death-of-hambirrao/)\]
    - "But the cost of this last great victory of the Maharatta army in Sambhaji’s reign was most expensive. In intelligent leadership, knowledge of the terrain and strategy, Hambirrao had been unmatched. Further, he was the only one who had dared to challenge Kalash and mitigate his negative effect on Sambhaji. As Kincaid the British commentator states, had the brave Hambirrao lived he had all the skill and resources to repulse the Mogol offensive. But with his death the Maharatta army in Maharashtra became rudderless. This was followed soon after by Sambhaji’s capture and execution by the Mogols."

- tArAbAyi, wife of rAjArAm, daugher of hambIr-rAv, who kept up the fight against the mughal-s.
    - She was later sidelined by a newly released shAhu and bAlAjI vishvanAtha. She propped up an impostor ( Rajaram II) and attempted various vain strategems - only to be foiled by bAlAjI. "On 14 September 1752, the two took oaths at Khandoba temple in Jejuri, promising mutual peace. At this oath ceremony, Tarabai also swore that Rajaram II was not her grandson, but an impostor from the Gondhali caste.\[6\] Nevertheless, Peshwa retained Rajaram II as the titular Chhhatrapati and a powerless figurehead."

Yet he sadly held bAjIrAv back when it came to completely uprooting the mogol empire\[[WP](https://kashcidvipashcit.wordpress.com/2016/01/14/bajiravs-hindu-delhi-empire-plan-thwarted/)\], held the mogol emperor in such regard and alleigence as to stop bAjIrAv from even constructing a gate facing north \[[TW](https://twitter.com/ColonelGerard/status/769971907689115651)\].

"Balaji convinced Shahu to alter Shivaji's old constitution of the Maratha state, whereby the nobles were salaried employees of the ruler.

Later Peshwa's & Maratha's lost sight of this (e.g. Bhau's quarrel with Suraj Mal on the eve of Panipat)."

        - "The treacherous conduct of a very large section of the Moslems in India in the Khilaphat (sic) agitation during the last Great War in 1914 has taught us a lesson never to be forgotten as it is almost sure to be repeated in any future attack on India on the North Western Frontier by any alien power. The tribesmen and the Moslem forces throughout Punjab, Sindh etc. are very likely to betray the Hindus and rise en masse in pursuance of the pan-Islamic designs to carve out an independent Moslem State or Federation stretching out from Baluchisthan–to Kashmir–to Delhi. In view of the attitude of many a responsible Moslem Organisation in India as revealed by their resolutions passed in their open sessions betraying their extra territorial sympathies it would be nothing short of a suicidal and purblind step on the part of the Hindus to make light of this serious danger threatening them. Under such an emergency they will have to ally themselves with the British forces in the common objective to avert this National calamity.”
        - "There is no question of co-operating or non-co-operating with the British Government in their war-efforts. The only question that you have before you is to find out how best you can turn this inevitable co-operation with the British as profitable to your own country as it is possible under our present circumstances to do." “Let the Hindus therefore come forward now and enter the army, the navy and the air-forces, the ordnance and other war-crafts factories in their thousands and millions.”

His letter: "The mlechas of England having captured our country, tread over the sanathana dharma of the Hindus and destroy them. Every Indian is trying to drive out the English and get swarajyam and restore sanathana dharma. Our Raman, Sivaji, Krishnan, Guru Govindan, Arjuna ruled our land protecting all dharmas and in this land they are making arrangements to crown George V, a mlecha, and one who eats the flesh of cows. Three thousand Madrasees have taken a vow to kill George V as soon as he lands in our country. In order to make others know our intention, I who am the least in the company, have done this deed this day. This is what everyone in Hindustan should consider it as his duty."

- [kEshav baLIrAm hEDagEvAr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._B._Hedgewar), hindu svarAjya activist, social reformer, RSS founder.
- [vallabh bhAi paTEl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel), Iron man of India, who dealt with the razAkar thugs of HyderAbAd, ensured accession of junAgarh and kAshmIr, who rebuilt sOmanAtha-shivAlaya.
- bhIm rAv [ambeDkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar), who strived for respect and opportunities for the untouchable jAti-s (sAvarkar on him: [img1](http://i.imgur.com/fhQO1Yf.jpg)) \- even at the cost of hinduism or Indian independence, an intelligent subversive inimical to hindus, used Christian categories to accomplish this (JDRoover [here](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/counterview-ambedkar-was-wrong-about-hinduism-the-right-can-stop-trying-to-appropriate-him)), who transformed into a hindu cultural nationalist ally (CR[1](http://centreright.in/2012/04/bodhi-sattvas-hindutva-part-1/), [ambedkar_partition](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/), sanskrit promotion [P1](http://i.imgur.com/h6N5vQ2.jpg) [T194909](https://twitter.com/Parikramah/status/582703386337792000),  ..) when circumstances made the continuation of British empire unlikely, and ultimately strived to ensure that dalita-s stay within the fold of dhArmic religions while rejecting caste hindu orthodoxy \[[T1936](https://twitter.com/parikramah/status/582704308262555648)\], a [clear thinker](http://www.ambedkar.org/pakistan/40C.Pakistan%20or%20the%20Partition%20of%20India%20PART%20II.htm) in regards to the security of hindustAn. 
    - "His education, encouraged and financed largely by the Gaikwad of Baroda, led to his role as the Untouchable's chief spokesman, the founder of a political party for Untouchables, and the moving spirit behind organizations, schools, and colleges established for their uplift."
    - It is clear that bhImrAv Ambedkar was not an advocate of Indian independence (if not openly against it at times). For example, AruN Shourie says about him \[[htm](http://www.rediff.com/freedom/29ambed1.htm) , [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/EVND0eu.png)\]: "The Untouchables have stayed out of the Freedom Movement for good and strong reasons, he says again and again."
    - His efforts to reactivate the mAhar regiment in the British army was only motivated by the desire for social upliftment rather than the "learn to fight and rebel" hopes of Savarkar.
    - bhImrAv was (mostly willingly) a sort of enemy agent (someone used by the Brits to weaken and fracture the high caste Hindu dominated Indian independence movement). We would have got rid of untouchability etc.. (as the Japanese, Koreans, French and Spaniards did) without him as well, while preserving more of a feeling of national brotherhood. But he was somehow pumped up, like the khujliwal of Delhi. (That British would use these dalit leaders to subvert and fracture the hindus who were demanding that they leave is a no-brainer.)
    - "In the 1930s and 40s, like other acclaimed heroes of social reform such as M.N. Roy and Periyar Ramaswamy Naicker, Dr. Ambedkar was literally a paid agent of the British, even becoming the Member for Labour of the Viceroy's Council." ([KE](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/books/wiah/ch11.htm))
    - This he did collude with the Brits (his big bet) and the preta-s. \[eg [here](http://www.sakshitimes.net/blog/2008/09/22/dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-defender-of-conversions-and-a-friend-of-christianity-294/)\] It is only late in his life, after his attempts to convince the Brits to rule on with dalit help failed \[[AS_Redif](https://www.rediff.com/freedom/29ambed.htm), [WP](https://aryasamajvserranthindus.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/dalits-helped-british-conquer-india-b-r-ambedkar/)\] that he decided to tie dalit fate with buddhists so as to not denationalize them from the Hindu society where they found themselves.
    - All this said, I do not begrudge bhImrAv - an intelligent enemy is better than a stupid friend. He knew when it was time to leave his treachery be. In that sense, it was far better that we deal with him than upper caste stupid "friends" such as the baldie and the chacha (without offence intended to anyone, this holds true today too).

Where there are heroes, villains are no surprise. Many were self-professed ghAzis (mujAhids intent on jihAd). Others power hungry people who pursued personal ambition at the cost of higher ideals.

A true exemplar of "kAshmIriyat".  
    
- Ghiyasuddin Al Damaghani, sultan of madurai, whose depravity is described by Ibn Batuta \[[AS16](https://agentsaffron.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/the-saviors-of-dharma-in-south-india-part-1/)\].

### Hindu charlatans

These bring the sanAtana dharma to disrepute, even as they deceive feeble hindu-s.

-  Swami Nithyananda - the center of a sex scandal in 2010s. Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyTT2UrTSCc) where he gleefully dances over his father's corpse, then 'liberates' it by stomping on its forehead, gives it diksha post mortem, and declares it a sishya-turned-sanyasi.

## Idiots

- yudhiShThira, he who did not foresake truth for the longest time - though lacking in kShatra, appropriately the subject of ridicule by kRShNa and bhIma on occasions.

- mOhanadAsa [gAndhI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi); a politician with great self-consciousness and personal integrity, a pioneer in civil disobidience, economic boycott, and non cooperation with the British invaders and of hunger strikes in convincing fellow Indians, while retaining non violence and hence greater respectability; a flawed person with a flawed social, economic and religious philosophy, who held [racist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_21XD74JKHw) attitudes against blacks, slept with young women to test his self control, thought all religions were "equal", preached non violence of Jews towards Nazis.
- satya sAyi bAba, the "vibhuti from thin air" trickster, who had some positive social impact in creating good hospitals and colleges, but was nevertheless a proponent of the "Honor and respect all religions as pathways to God." nonsense.
