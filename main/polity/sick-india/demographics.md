        - Census data show that Christian population DROPPED by 5% in AP between 2011 and 2001 (1129784/1,181,917). Anyone who believes, knowing the ground reality, this is a fool. AP has been the center of evangelism in South India for 10+ years with churches everywhere and every place, evangelist posters all over including remote villages.
        - "The ‘adjusted data’, which was unlawfully manufactured by deleting 3.67 crore Indians living in Assam and Jammu & Kashmir, showed that in percentage terms the Muslim population was growing barely at 29.5 percent as against 36 percent increase revealed during the actual headcount. ... There is an asterix marked footnote below the Statement 1-a of the Religion-wise data of Census 2001 which gives the proportion and growth rate of the respective population of religious communities for the last four decades from 1961 to 2001. The footnote clearly states that it “excludes Jammu & Kashmir and Assam for all decades from 1961 to 2001”. "\[[IT15](http://indiatomorrow.co/nation/3778-fudging-of-census-data-continues-while-the-bjp-slumbers)\]

    - "Directly taking on the popular Family Planning slogan 'Small Family, Happy Family', the Syro-Malabar Church (SMC), the country's largest Catholic Church with 3.6 million members, has come out with its own slogan: 'Large Family, Happy Family'." Paid 10k+ for having 5+ children. \[[TOI](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kerala-catholic-church-asks-families-to-have-more-than-2-kids/1/154956.html)\]
- Highlights and anecdotes
    - "The census 2001 data of the 6 year-old cohorts clearly shows that in 31 States and Union Territories of Indian Republic, out of a total of 35, the Muslim population will grow at a faster clip than that of Hindus." (Esp. Assam, Kerala, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar)
    - "The classic example is Haryana where Muslims have increased to 8% of total population from 2% within 6 decades. A further four-fold increase in the next few decades shall take them to 32% of population." \[[SP](https://vajrin.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/demography-elections-and-memetic-viruses/)\]
    - TN 2015: "they're buying land and building a mosque every 3 kms along every highway, purportedly for the convenience of travellers, but this can be used as choke points."
- The effect of polygamy
    - "In other words, the more sister-wives a Mormon woman had, the fewer children she was likely to produce." ([G](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/feb/27/mormon-polygamists-fruit-fly)).

## Projected changes

The situation: the rapidly increasing proportion of Abrahamists in India (and more broadly, worldwide), leading to Hindu composition falling below the 50% mark at least before 2100 (see [GS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ey-j5gUt5CavCGghUqrsGncftRzy1TRFjNXah8kb5A/edit#gid=1)) if we fail to respond. How should hindus respond?

### Prospects of stabilization

The Sachar committee report cites projections (See page 45 \[or 65\] of [this](http://zakatindia.org/Files/Sachar%20Report%20(Full).pdf) pdf) assumes that Muslim fertility will drop to replacement level and thence converge to Hindu fertility levels by either 2030 or 2041; while Elst [does not](http://www.bharatvani.org/books/demogislam/index.html) anticipate such stabilization. Erik Kaufman [agrees](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2cENue7JxI&feature=share). Hans Rosling [asserts that](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies.html) the world population will stabilize at 10 billion; and that fertility is more directly correlated with access to contraceptives and female involvement in the work-force rather than religion. However, observations from gapminder and articles such as [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jul/07/zoe-williams-nepal-contraception-pregnancy?fb=native&CMP=FBCNETTXT9038) (“There is some resistance among Muslim communities, but most people are Hindus.”) suggest that access to contraceptives and female involvement in the work-force is correlated with religion. Unlike Rosling, Melinda Gates [acknowledges](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=2BOTS9GAjc4#t=1233s) that unless such opposition is overcome, he is wrong in his hopes for stabilization - and specifically mentions Afghanistan, Sub-Saharan Africa, Uttar Pradesh, Catholic doctrine.

  

### Demographic reversals elsewhere

- Ancient Greek and Roman examples dealt with [here](https://sites.google.com/site/hinduvichaarah/8-other-pagans/1-pre-xtian-europe).
- Goa
- Annexation of sikkim
- Lebanon: "By 1970, the Christians had landed themselves in a declining fertility rate of 4 children per woman, while the Muslims maintained a steady fertility rate of 6 children per woman. The result was that between 1965 and 1970 Lebanon became a Muslim majority country during a raging civil war. In the ensuing bloodbath and mayhem nearly five million Christians out-migrated within 2-3 years."\[[IT15](http://indiatomorrow.co/nation/3778-fudging-of-census-data-continues-while-the-bjp-slumbers)\]

## Proposed hindu responses

Discussions - [TW](https://twitter.com/kashcit/status/636394204474683392), [WP](https://kashcidvipashcit.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/proposed-hindu-responses-to-demographic-projections/?fb_action_ids=10153199594647989&fb_action_types=news.publishes).

- **Threats** to India due to demographic changes in the foreseeable future.
    - A second partition involving Assam, Bengal, Kashmir. 
        - Possibly also Telangana and Kerala. These are not too precarious, being surrounded by Hindu majority states.
    - A large scale all-India Islamic rebellion.
        - Examples from elsewhere:
            - Dungan Rebellion of China \[[WI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_Revolt_(1862%E2%80%9377))\]
            - Christian rebellion of Japan.
- **Potential weaknesses** in our response
    - Racial admixture in our population makes it harder for us to be ruthless, since the inimical population and their backers look like us.
        - Motivating studies: 
            - Empathy constrained: Prejudice predicts reduced mental simulation of actions during observation of outgroups. \[[pdf](http://www.researchgate.net/publictopics.PublicPostFileLoader.html?id=512385f4e24a465848000000&key=9fcfd512385f426ae9)\]
        - Contrast with the homogenous Chinese and Japanese. Their homogeneity makes it easy for them to view converts as a fifth column of aliens and be ruthless.
    - Suicidal philosophies "Idiot's vedanta" causes people to mistakenly believe that it is ok to tolerate Abrahamisms.
    - Multiple front battle, dealing with: economically powerful Islamic states, western christian/ post-christian christian and Han imperialist powers.
    - We are more divided (eg. by jAti-s competing for reservation) than they are.
- Ideas for **strengthening the position of hindus in the Indian** homeland.
    - Resettle Hindus from hindu-majority states like Himachal Pradesh in precarious states like Kashmir and Assam. 
    - Stem or reverse the influx of muslim migrants from Bangladesh and Burma.
    - Increase Hindu birthrate - through conscience, education and incentives.
    - Suppress and cap the abrahamist birthrate (eg. by incentivizing or mandating sterilization).
    - Maintain Hindu battle readiness and military participation. Require military service.
    - Suppress Abrahamist ideology ruthlessly. (This is hard.)
        - As a very first step, tackle foreign missionaries and chruch funded NGO-s.
        - Small scale and half hearted "ghar vApasi-s" and polemics cannot keep up with Muslim fertility.
        - Hinduize our critical institutions, especially the military.
- **Have a plan B if India falls**: How to strategically spread out to ensure Hindu survival.
    - This is not to deny that we should do our best to improve Hindu position in India, but it is not a wise survival strategy to entirely concentrate there.
    - **Desiderata** about the "destination".
        - The destination must have the economic ability to support new arrivals.
        - It is better if the natives of the "destination" are a mixture of races and ethnicities, so that racial hatred and ethnic cleansing is much less likely.
        - It is better if the "destination" has a strong pagan undercurrent.
    - Strategic things Hindus should do **upon arriving at the ****"destination"**.
        - Don't just focus on making money, getting civil power and winning spelling bees. Do not neglect "military power and participation".
            - Remember the lessons from Uganda and Fiji.
    - **Proposed destinations**
        - South and central america. (Racial admixture, extant hindu foothold in the north, large pagan undercurrent.)
- **Lessons from other populations**.
    - Modern Orthodox Jews lead successful professional lives, while maintaining an orthodox lifestyle and having large families.
        - Eg. Robert Aumann the Nobel Laureate economist.
    - Mormon families are similar large.
        - Fertility pattern: Summary from [MF_E15](http://mormonfertility.blogspot.com/).
            - Observations
                - 1\. Larger than replacement level numbers of children.   (That is to say significantly higher than 2.1 children per woman, on average). 
                - 2\. Despite widespread use of contraception. This implies that for Mormons family size is usually chosen deliberately. (By contrast, other religious groups with significantly above-replacement fertility do not allow contraception.)
                - 3\. In a group of people who are more educated than average and economically more successful than average. 
                - 4\. Average fertility (numbers of children) tends to be highest among the most educated and wealthiest Mormons.
            - Explanation: The pattern of Mormon fertility could be explained in a general sense as a combination of two forces: one tending to increase family size, the other tending to limit family size. 
                - 1\. On the one hand, Mormonism encourages large families, yet 
                - 2\. On the other hand Mormonism encourages what might briefly be described as 'self-reliance' - in the sense that the ideal Mormon family unit should be able (as a rule) to support itself without assistance from outside the family. (Indeed, the Mormon family ought to aim to generate a surplus to use on church activities such as buildings and mission work - it should also be noted that virtually no money goes on salaries, since Mormon Priests (all adult men in good standing), Bishops and Stake Presidents, are all unpaid part-timers - hence indeed they usually subsidise these roles from other jobs.)
                - 3\. The combination leads to wealthier Mormon families being the largest, on average, since they can afford to bring up larger numbers of children decently, without using external resources. Presumably poorer Mormons must necessarily limit their family sizes voluntarily by means of contraception.
    - Ultra Orthodox Jew males simply collect state money, study torah and breed - women may work to provide additional support, and they are socialized to value the best Torah scholar.
    - Jews very deliberately study and strategize for their survival.
        - Eg. UK-demography [study](http://www.jpr.org.uk/publications/tag.demography). Considering to the rise of India and China [IS](http://isteve.blogspot.ca/2010/07/china-v-india-which-will-be-good-for.html).
        - Dr. Shalom Wald \[[bookz](http://bookzz.org/book/2493368/cfbd55)\], who "chose 14 well-known historians, from Thucydides to Gibbon, Spangler, Toynbee and Kennedy, and examined their theories concerning the circumstances in which civilizations flourish or collapse. Then he tried to examine how these theories can be applied to the context of the Jewish people." One major recommendation was that Jews do not concentrate entirely in Israel - it is not the best survival strategy.
    - Modern orthodox jews conduct military-style camps which militarily prepare youth. This has led to the recent ascent of orthodox Jewish officers in the Israeli army.
    - Missionary mentality vs group cohesion tension
        - SP: "What I read from Eric Kaufmann and Michael Blume is that in first world industrialized countries the optimal strategy for growth is what they call "preach and breed" i.e., missions in the early days to form a core group of committed members, followed by erection of some barriers against the outside secular world, and maintenance of a high birth rate. Blume had once shared a research paper which concluded this but I can no longer find it as he took down his old blog posts. Their explanation is that groups like Jehovah's Witnesses that evangelize a lot also tend to lose out a lot because outsiders (as in the new converts) often bring in outside/secular influences consciously or not. These barriers also connect with what Kaufmann calls strong religion and Richard Sosis research on costly signaling. Paradoxically its the most liberal/few rules churches and religious groups that seem to lose the most members to secularization while religious groups that require you to make an effort and invest your time and follow rules have stronger retention rates."

## Actual response of hindus

- Bishnois don't cut down trees or kill animals ([PJ](http://www.academia.edu/211074/The_Bishnoi_An_Ecotheological_Community_in_the_Indian_Desert), [FV](http://www.franckvogel.com/english/portfolio-bishnois.html)), they don't let in outsiders into their villages (especially muslims). They have high TFR (anecdotes).
    - This can be contrasted by some brahmanas selling agrahara lands to muslims for money in TN (who overpay to get a foothold - via ravilochanan).
- sindhi and gujarAti traders are spread through out the world.
