## Desiderata (cross-national)  

We are in favor of the following (subject to change):

- A strong revival of paganism (potentially bound by the meta-template of hinduism) as an alternative to the Abrahamic religions.
- Protection of individual freedom to the maximum possible extant.
    - Freedom of speech and its limits - see [here](../polity/external-affairs/tolerance.md).
    - Marijuana should be legalized and regulated - just like alcohol, tobacco, red bull and coffee.
        - Marijuana is less harmful than alcohol.
        - The system then has a better shot at preventing/ reducing negative effects.  
            
    - Gambling and prostitution should be legal and regulated.
        - The system then has a better shot at preventing/ reducing negative effects.
    - Homosexuality is not criminal.
        - Some people are born with homosexual tendencies. Some may choose not to express them.  
            
        - They are no more likely to be child predators than heterosexuals.
        - Sexual preferences of children raised by homosexual parents are comparable to those raised by heterosexual parents.
        - On traditional hindu tolerance - even acceptance - [see here??](../social-cultivation/dharma.md).  
            
    - Weapons.
        - It is against hindu tradition that good people should be unarmed. ([SB1](http://i.imgur.com/uwX4xGV.jpg).)
- Broad-based economic development.
    - Taxation should be based on consumption, rather than earning/ income.
        - So, no corporate or individual income tax.
- An engaged (non-apathetic) citizenry.
    - Citizens are not stupid or lazy, but systems which invite participation (at the right level and in the right form) ought to be in place.  
        
- Good and efficient governance. This means low corruption, putting public good ahead of narrow interests.
    - Having an efficient and effective law enforcement apparatus.
- Prevention of animal cruelty, protection of sentient life. The earth is not ours alone.
    - This makes (commonly cruel) halaal slaughter illegal.
- Care for the environment, minimization of pollution.
