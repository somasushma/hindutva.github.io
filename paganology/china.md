## Thought background

- [YT course 1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ZsbWm-KwKYOgaet04QWYQ).
- Legalism ([T0](https://storify.com/dawdlerMe/on-legalism?utm_campaign&utm_content=storify-pingback&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&awesm=sfy.co_r0jGg), [T1](https://twitter.com/vvkbkvv/status/517093851623075840), [T2](https://twitter.com/vvkbkvv/status/528002893023293440).)
    - Ideas
        - Human behavior must be controlled by strictly imposed laws.
        - Unswerving loyalty to the ruler of the state is a top priority.
            - Whatever contributes to the states power and orderliness should be deemed right.
                - Rejection of Confician ethics to which even monarchs must adhere.
            - Rejection of inherited official position. Rely on military-style merit instead.
        - Strengthening the state.
            - Focus on food production and military buildup.
    - Absorption of confucian hierarchical ideas
        - "The Legalist-Confucian combination can be seen as an appropriation of Confucian ideals by power-holders who are quite willing to ignore the moral demands of the doctrine and settle, instead, for an emphasis on authority and hierarchy. From the time of the Han dynasty this amalgamation was known as Yangru, Yinfa- 阳儒阴法 - which could be translated as Confucianism as the bright yang outside, and Legalism as the dark yin inside. " 
        - Distinction from confucianism: [Mao1](https://i.imgur.com/tNETsQz.jpg).
    - Implementation
        - Chin Shi Huang-di who built the wall and combined it with the terror of genocidal slaughters \[a fact much admired by Mao in recent times\]; the rulers of the Han dynasty thereafter built huge infantry forces and fortified settlements.

## Christian and anti-christian outbreaks

- White lotus / red turban rebellion
    - The White Lotus originated as a hybrid movement of Buddhism and Manichaeism that emphasised strict vegetarianism and permitted men and women to interact freely, which was socially shocking. Like other secret societies, they covered up their unusual or illicit activities as "incense-burning ceremonies".
    - Successfully overthrew the yuan, abandoning heterodox roots in the end.
- Taiping civil war.
    - "a curious Chinese civil war, which took place in 1850-1860s, whose geopolitical significance is often lost. Hong Xiuquan a failed Han Chinese civil service aspirant heard the sermons of the American protestant preacher Edwin Stevens and studied his pamphlets on Christianity. Inspired by these and the frustrations of his repeated academic failures he started imagining himself as the Chinese brother of Jesus Christ. Further, inspired in his visions by the teachings of another American Southern Baptist missionary he worked to create his own version of the Christian bible – the Taiping bible. Imbibing various Abrahamistic traits he founded his own iconoclastic cult that started destroying images of the bauddha-s and cīna deities. Notably, his flavor of Chinese Abrahamism had the same traits of iconoclasm, communism, sexual equality and utopianism, which independently arose in other secularized Abrahamistic movements within the Christian world itself (This illustrates that Abrahamism has a powerful potential to channelize such delusions. It is also notable how Hong’s fervor later inspired the Han nationalist Sun Yat-sen ). By 1851 CE Hong had organized a large army, which now seeking to establish the utopian “Heavenly Kingdom” initiated a civil war against the Ching dynasty. Hong’s forces killed the Manchu commander sent against the them and he established himself with Nanjing as his capital. Before its end the Taiping civil war had left 30 million dead or more – a true outbreak of an Abrahamistic disease." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/braided-power-a-brief-note-on-last-great-steppe-power-the-mongol-manchu-system/)17\]
    - Remnants merged with the Nian, which was originally inspired by the White Lotus movement. "The British, Americans and French realized that if the Chinese Abrahamism triumphed over the Ching then the center of gravity of Abrahamism might shift from their world to Asia. They perceived this as a disaster as it would gnaw into the very scaffold of their identity and sense of self-worth, namely Abrahamism; hence, they decided to tacitly back the Ching government rather than the rebels." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/braided-power-a-brief-note-on-last-great-steppe-power-the-mongol-manchu-system/)17\]
- The Boxer Rebellion, Boxer Uprising or Yihetuan Movement, was a violent anti-foreign, anti-colonial, and anti-Christian uprising that took place in China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the Qing dynasty. Chinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers and those favoring conciliation.  The Eight-Nation Alliance, after being initially turned back, brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army, and arrived at Peking on August 14, relieving the siege of the Legations.

- Further jihAd-s
    - "They didn't stop @ Dungan either, there was Dungan 2 in 1894-96, TIRET in 1930's (syrian ghazi Tawfiq Bay), Ili in 40's."
    - Muslim Conflict in Gansu was when a coalition of Muslim Generals broke out in revolt against the Guominjun in 1927.
    - Ngolok rebellion
        - a series of military campaigns against unconquered Ngolok (Golok) tribal Tibetan areas of Qinghai (Amdo), undertaken by two Hui commanders, Gen. Ma Qi and Gen. Ma Bufang, on behalf of the Beiyang and Kuomintang governments of the Republic of China.
        - "After ethnic rioting between Hui and Tibetans erupted in 1918, Ma Qi defeated the Tibetans. He heavily taxed the town for eight years. In 1925 a rebellion broke out, and thousands of Tibetans drove out the Hui. Ma Qi responded with 3,000 Hui Chinese troops, who retook Labrang and machine-gunned thousands of Tibetan monks as they tried to flee.\[5\] Ma Qi besieged Labrang numerous times but the Tibetans and Mongols fiercely resisted his Hui forces until Ma Qi gave it up in 1927.\[6\] However, that was not the last Labrang saw of Gen. Ma. The Hui forces looted and ravaged the monastery again. In revenge Tibetan Nomads skinned alive many hui soldiers. One of the most common practice was to slice open the stomach of a still alive soldier and than put hot rock inside the stomach. Many hui women were sold to the ethnic Han and Kazakhs. Children were adopted by the Tibetans."
        - Later repurcussions
            - "Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. "
- Under japanese:
    - "Soldiers smeared mosques with pork fat, forced Hui to butcher pigs to feed soldiers and forced young women to serve as sex slaves under the pretense of training them as geishas and singers. Hui cemeteries were destroyed. Many Hui [fought against Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Muslims_in_the_Second_Sino-Japanese_war). "
