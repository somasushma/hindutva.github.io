---


- Post 16th century Japan.
    - Provocations: planned subversion \[[SP](https://vajrin.wordpress.com/2014/05/18/christian-missionaries-the-vanguard-of-western-imperialism/)\], burning temples \[[P1](http://i.imgur.com/z1bvkIC.png), [H](http://i.imgur.com/MlR8cKX.jpg)\], selling Japanese into slavery \[[H](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/585565928202629121)\], rabid conversion \[[H](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/585565928202629121)\], conversion for money \[[N](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/607506211903295488)\] and forcible conversions of the populace by Christian daimyo.
    - Innate resistance
        - Filial piety helped. [SP_T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/607575601994702851).
    - Tactics [vajrin](http://vajrin.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/how-japan-dealt-with-the-christian-threat/), [JT](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/12/20/national/history/christian-missionaries-find-japan-tough-nut-crack/#.VJ92m3QQA), [P1](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2014/02/destroying-japanese-christianity/), [P2](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2014/02/denying-the-faith/):
        - Initial identification and treatment:
            - Deportation - even of half-breed offspring \[Hideyoshi - [T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/582959717594599424)\], even early threats to deal with them abroad \[[T2](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/513860093784653826)\]
            - Torture for apostacy - with an inquisitor until 1792, Eg. Cristóvão Ferreira ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crist%C3%B3v%C3%A3o_Ferreira))
            - death if that fails,
            - checking prostitutes \[[T](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/604434746475728898)\]
        - Watching for reversion
            - domestic surveillance of descendants for many generations,
            - public awareness through anti-christian events (which involved Public testing)
        - Guarding against repeat ignitions from outside
            - closing the country,
                - Isolation and monitoring of the dutch.
            - controlling borders against infiltrators,
            - Information gathering
            - Book censorship.
    - Christian resistance
        - Hopes: Assassination \[[T](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/583822640512692224)\], civil war \[[T](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/596169847182090240)\].
    - Remarkable cross-generational memory among the elite and continued external vigilence \[[T1](http://i.imgur.com/25I0heV.jpg)\]
        - "after getting rid of xtians japan adopts a closed door policy in 1630s to west except for dutch who werent in2 proselytism but they r kept confined a small artificial island off nagasaki with severe restrictions on display of their xtian beliefs, that way they wud trade with japan. every yr they were required to submit details of major world events to shogun esp any catholic plots. from mid 1700's though forbidden some j intellectuals began to study dutch texts for medical knowledge and began translating them into japanese, soon dutch studies (called rangaku) acquired a following, and thru this japanese intellectuals had acquired some knowledge of outside events including western expansion. .. by 1790's russians reached far east of siberia and close to japan, rus ships began calling for trade, followed by other western ships including brits intruding, so j intellectuals including aizawa began intensifying their study of the west even though it was largely forbidden by the shogunate"
    - A clear undestanding of the barbarian use of Christianity and Islam to inspire extra-territorial loyalty.
        - Aizawa Seishisai \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/564239987659374592), [T3](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/589826629486129152), [T4](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/618907412196667393)\]
            - "Our way of virtue and their deceitful techniques are as incompatible as fire and ice. The universe is not enough to contain us both."
- Post-Meiji Japan
    - Pre-WW2
        - "There is another poorly known aspect of the war which is the role of the preta missionaries. They were key in spreading anti Japanese propaganda back home in mleccha lands. In the 1930's Inazo Nitobe gave some speeches here in North America and in one of them he warned the missionaries to stay out of the war between Japan and China." \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/603679432386191360), [T2](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/611913981121417216)\]
        - As a ganging-up tactic in international policy and cooperation
            - Chiang (he was a methodist) used his Christian outer cover to get the mlecchas to back him.
            - "just read the war letters or war propaganda & u will see the heathen angle played up while chiang was presented as a god fearing christian. 1 american woman wrote a letter during the war saying how she wud rather be ruled by the germans for they were at least xtians unlike the heathen japs. Even during the russo-japanese war, count cassini's campaign in US was to plead that unless the heathen japs were defeated by his rus, xtianizing asia would be impossible."
            - "After the war the settlement negotiations happened at portsmouth in US with teddy roosevelt as negotiator. 1 of the tricks the rus delegation adopted was to play up their xtianity to get a better settlement (which they did considering they lost) like attending church regularly, the japanese delegation had to follow suit so that public opinion wouldn't be too against them." \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/482247445246537729), \]
    - Post WW2
        - Mc Arthur attempted christianization.
            - "THE ARM OF ST. FRANCIS XAVIER  Once again it is raised on high in fight against Japanese paganism  LIFE 27 Jun 1949 " \[[T](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/462652418241478657)\]
        - Mc Arthur was scared of communists, so he wanted to keep the emperor.
        - Non-aggression was accepted mostly to ensure that Hirohito would not be tried as a "war criminal".
        - Secularism was accepted into the constitution deference to the occupying forces.
        - Public education was revised to inculcate secular and such values.
            - This is being reversed only now \[[A1](http://s24.postimg.org/yjsz4xmk5/List1.png), [A2](http://s30.postimg.org/3rfa7a55d/List1.png)\]
        - Many reverted.
            - The Imperial family pretence \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/546527765479321600)\]
            - Rice christian effect. \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/dJFvDxp.jpg), [T2](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/611913981121417216)\]
            - "tht only brought bak xtians to pre war levels because the war killed j pretas disproportionately, for e.g. they were conc in cities which got bombed more and nagasaki was center of xtianity in japan ever since portuguese contact in 1500's"
