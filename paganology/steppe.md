        - "Hunnic Mongols led by their Kha’Khan Tuguhun established the eponymous kingdom in central Asia (called Azha by the Tibetans). He conquered the Tarim region and extended his sway in direction of Kashgar, taking Khotan in the south and part of what is now Kyrgyzstan. He was what one might call a lesser, proto-version of Chingiz Kha’Khan – he re-organized the administration, introduced a written script for the old Mongolian dialect and even introduced agricultural sectors in his kingdom which complemented the pastoral lifestyle of his peoples. "
    - [Kök Türük (Gök Türk = Blue Turk)](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/the-epic-on-stone/)
        - "However, legacy of the Blue Turks was lasting one- it gave the Turks the the concept of a nation, ethnic identity and made them into a civilizational influence. This  was also influenced the Mongols who had made similar earlier attempts at nationhoods in founding the two great Hunnic Khanates \[commonly termed the Xiongnu and Rouran or Juan-Juan Khanates\]. .. Their rise for the Turks was as momentous as the rise of the Bharatas amidst the Indo-Aryans. ... However, it had not sunk deep enough for the transformation of the entire Altaic people. Here lie the roots of modern Turkey and the Central Asian Stans’  identity crisis  which was hijacked by the desert delusion in the centuries to come.

Yet they were able to destroy the external influences and re-establish the Shari’a." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]
                - "Due to the Mohammedan persecution of various groups favored by Arghun he came up with a plan to conquer Mecca and restore heathen worship there with construction of temples of buddhakapAla and heruka, but due to other preoccupations he failed to do so. Indeed, during the Ilkhanid regime multiple temples to buddhakapAla, kAlachakra and hevajra had been built in Baghdad, Tabriz and in some places in the province of Khurasan." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]

        - "Chingizids of the Qubilaid line might have waned into anonymity had they found a new leader in the form of the direct descendent of Qubilai Khan, Puṇyaśrī Oljei Temür. On one hand Puṇyaśrī was a learned Sanskritist, with literary interests going beyond the vajrayāṇa tantra-s and encompassing the works of Daṇḍin and Bhojadeva Paramāra. On the other he was a vigorous warrior who started rebuilding the Mongol army and drew back the Arans to his side. He repulsed the Ming thrusts into Mongolia and struck out at the Chinese forces in several encounters to the south. ... in 1424 CE the Arans and Puṇyaśrī had a falling out and the latter was killed in the conflict." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/some-notes-on-the-rise-of-oirat-power-and-the-jangar-tuuli/)\]

    - manchu
- Indic islands in the Tarim basin
    - "In 615 AD, the 3 Central Asian kingdoms of Kucha, Agni (later Qara Shahar) and Khotan were islands of the Indic civilization in the Tarim Basin. They were at the pinnacle of their power and prosperity and were great centers of Sanksritic learning, producing a variety of texts on buddhist and classical hindu philosophies. .. The new king of Kucha, suvarNadeva renewed the non-aggression pact with Tai-tsung, the expansionist Chinese emperor. In all likelihood Hsuen Tsang was also acting as a spy to the emperor and providing him intelligence regarding these Indic Kingdoms. Shortly after Hsuen Tsang passed through this region, Tai-tsung decided to swallow these kingdoms, without much of a warning. ... Thus, the Tarim basin passed from the Indian cultural zone to the yoke of the Chinese. All traces of Indic civilization in this region were subsequently erased with the conquest of this region from the Chinese by the Tibetan hordes, followed by its conquest by the great Uighur Kha’khans of Mongolia." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/24/destruction-of-the-4-central-asian-indic-garrisons/)\]
