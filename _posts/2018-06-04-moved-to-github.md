A Google sites website can be effectively DoS-ed using malicious complaints having no sound basis. This happened to our site (and we were never notified). Of course, Google consistently restored access to our site upon appeal - but the whole situation of Google mediating public access to our writing and brain-dead monkeys being able to kill access to our site was bothersome.

Hence we moved our data and site to <https://hindutva.github.io/> . Contributions are welcome!
